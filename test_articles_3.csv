407,https://www.dailyherald.com/discuss/20230823/illinois-lagging-in-encouraging-ev-purchases/,2023-08-23 01:00:00,Bruce Mainzer Guest columnist,"Last month, Gov. J.B. Pritzker led a trade mission to the UK, where he promoted Illinois to investors as the electric vehicle mecca. But as Pritzker tries to expand on his vision of having a million electric vehicles registered in the state by 2030, the reality is that current electric vehicle development in the state is falling far short of his vision.
With the climate crisis becoming more of an emergency, there is a pressing need to quickly decarbonize automobiles and trucks. Pritzker's vision is laudable, but we doubt that the governor accurately depicted to UK investors the dysfunction that hampers Illinois' competitiveness as both a haven for manufacturing electric vehicles and a state that makes it easy for consumers to own an electric vehicle.
In 2021, Pritzker signed The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), which provides a $4,000 credit to any Illinois taxpayer who bought an electric vehicle. It went into effect in 2022, distributing $20.5 million until the funds ran out. Based on the rebate program statistics provided on the Illinois EPA website, about 1,700 electric vehicle purchasers were told that the fund had run out of money. This year's funding for the rebate is only $12.5 million, clearly not enough.
Assuming no growth at all in electric vehicle rebate submissions from last year to this year (which is unlikely, as electric vehicle purchases should increase), there will be at least 14,200 people eligible for a rebate and only 3,125 rebates awarded, assuming all applications are eventually accepted. In other words, 75% of applicants will be rejected. How does denying 75% of new electric vehicle owners their rebate fulfill the vision of a state that is a haven for electric vehicles?
One would assume Pritzker's vision would result in Illinois supporting California's Advanced Clean Cars II rule. These rules require that manufacturers meet increasing targets for zero/low emission sales of automobiles until 2035, at which point 100% of all automobile sales must be zero emission or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Washington, and Oregon have adopted California's standards, and presumably, more states will sign on to these rules. But Illinois has not adopted these standards. Why not?
Similarly, Illinois still has not committed to California's Advanced Clean Truck rules. To date, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Washington have also accepted these rules, which require manufacturers of trucks to sell an increasing percentage of zero-emission trucks as part of their annual sales from 2024 to 2035.
Pritzker is proud of the new Lion electric school bus factory in Joliet. The 900,000-square-foot facility is the largest U.S. plant dedicated to medium and heavy-duty commercial electric vehicles. But since Pritzker lured Lion to Joliet in 2021, other states are attracting far more electric vehicle manufacturing. Georgia has attracted $23 billion in new electric vehicle investments since 2018. Georgia even has succeeded in convincing Illinois' other electric vehicle manufacturer, Rivian, to expand in the suburbs of Atlanta with a new factory with 7,500 employees, instead of further expanding in Illinois.
Illinois could help Lion by providing incentives with funding to school districts throughout Illinois. There are about 35,000 school buses in the state. The Illinois EPA has modest funding for school districts to replace diesel school buses with electric school buses. However, the program contains a morass of difficult-to-meet criteria, and only a limited number of Illinois school districts have successfully qualified for the program. According to the Illinois EPA website, only 23 electric school buses have been funded through the Illinois EPA program so far. In contrast, New York's state legislature passed a law mandating all new school bus purchases must be electric starting in 2027 and the entire 50,000 school bus fleet must be electric by 2035. The New York legislation is backed by solid funding via a $500 million environmental bond act.
It is not a surprise that Illinois does not perform well in state rankings of electric vehicle policies. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization, created a 2023 scorecard on states' electric vehicle adoption policies. Illinois ranked at an unimpressive number 21 out of all states.
Illinois must do better. Now that the governor is back from his trip, we suggest that Pritzker and the state legislature take meaningful steps to fulfill his vision of 1 million electric vehicles registered in the state by 2030. Otherwise, Pritzker's vision will remain all talk as other states take the lead in meeting the decarbonized transportation future.

3118,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ankitmishra/2023/08/21/3-key-measures-to-advance-2030-climate-change-goals-in-the-united-states/,2023-08-21 08:30:00,Ankit Mishra,"In April 2021, the United States announced its plan to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50–52% from 2005 levels and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The critical components of President Biden’s plan to implement these targets include passing the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL BIL ), which are expected to unlock investments into clean energy technologies and improve U.S. economic competitiveness, innovation, and industrial productivity.
More recently, complementary measures such as the national target of 50% electric vehicle sales share in 2030, 100% carbon pollution-free electricity production by 2035 and the U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan have also been adopted to decarbonise the transportation, electricity and industrial sectors, which are 28%, 25% and 23% of U.S.’s overall emissions, respectively.
However, based on Rhodium Group’s latest report that evaluated the U.S.’s pathways to achieving its climate targets following the passing of the IRA and BIL congressional bills stated the U.S. is on track for a 32-42% reduction in GHG emissions below 2005 levels in 2030—bending the U.S. emissions curve down toward deeper decarbonisation, but still not enough to achieve the 50-52 per cent reduction from 2005 levels targets announced by President Biden.
Key findings from Rhodium Group’s report highlight that new laws have to be fully implemented, which contain a suite of regulations designed to curb pollution from cars, power plants, and factories to lower clean energy costs, along with new federal pollution standards.
In a series of interviews, leading experts provide insights into how agricultural innovation, sustainable infrastructure development in cities, and green upskilling can play a key role in helping the U.S. reduce its GHG emissions to 2030 targets.
‘Regenerative agriculture’ practices can help mitigate agriculture's rising GHG emissions
In the United States, agriculture accounted for 10% of total GHG emissions in 2021. Since 1990, U.S. GHG emissions have decreased by just over 2%, while agricultural emissions have increased by 7%. Rhodium Group’s climate modelling shows that the sector’s share of U.S. emissions could top 15% by 2030, as emissions are likely to remain flat.
A new report from the Environmental Defense Fund notes that for the U.S. to meet its 2030 climate goals, the agriculture sector’s GHG emissions must be cut by 25% and carbon dioxide removals from forests increased by 43% from 2018 levels. Technological innovation will be required to address the sector’s main GHG emissions: methane and nitrous oxide. Most methane emissions are driven by livestock (via enteric fermentation and manure), while crop and grassland fertilisation is the primary source of nitrous oxide (Chart 1).
Chart 1: US Agriculture Emissions by Gas GAS and Emission, 2020
Nancy Pfund, founder and managing partner at DBL Partners, says that, to reduce the food and agriculture sector’s GHG emissions while feeding a growing population, “it will be essential that the U.S. shift to low-carbon farming practices like regenerative agriculture, which have the potential to eliminate 250 million metric tons of CO2 per year, equivalent to 5% of U.S. emissions. Pairing these sustainable practices with the adoption of new technologies can accelerate the path to net-zero agriculture”. Pfund notes, for instance, precision spraying, such as a bolt-on system developed by Greeneye Technology, can reduce herbicide usage by as much as 90% while reducing costs for farmers.
But reducing GHG emissions while increasing production requires investment. PwC’s State of Climate Tech Report 2022 notes that the agriculture, food, and land use sector received 12% of global venture funding but contributed 22% of global GHG emissions in 2019 (Chart 2).
Chart 2: Share of Global Emissions and Climatetech Venture Investment by Sector
At a time when the climatetech sector is generally seeing a dip in venture financing, the development of new technological solutions (Chart 3) is critical to reaching U.S. climate targets and addressing the growing concern about rising global temperatures.
Chart 3: The Agriculture Sector’s Net Zero Scenario, by Technology, in 2050
As a result, according to Pfund, “the U.S. will need big sustainable agriculture companies to emerge and build fundamentally more efficient and less carbon-intensive supply chains. For these companies to have real staying power, it is essential to prioritise building solutions that are low-carbon and compelling for farmers, regardless of their political beliefs and stance on climate”.
Based on the Stanford Law and Bezos Earth Fund Report on Climate-Smart Agriculture, an essential way of advancing sustainable growth in agriculture is by improving the limited public data currently available on measuring and monitoring agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. government has started recognizing the importance of this and allocated $300 million to the Department of Agriculture to quantify, monitor, and track climate benefits via field-based data.
According to Pfund, “if we can’t track these emissions, it’s difficult to validate the climate benefits of low-carbon agricultural practices so that we can deploy them at scale.” Pfund notes, ""we also need policymakers to help improve confidence in the validity of regenerative agriculture solutions and put guardrails in place for a functioning market so that we can reward farmers for their environmental stewardship while helping companies decarbonise existing operations to meet net-zero commitments”.
Advance policies to promote sustainable infrastructure development in cities
In 2021, more than 100 U.S. cities pledged to halve emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050. But a recent study of the U.S.’s 38 biggest cities reveals that only about 20 are on track to reach their 2050 climate goals. With nearly three-quarters of the carbon dioxide generated from fossil fuels in the United States coming from cities, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy notes that cities must track their GHG emissions data, leverage technological solutions, and promote electrification in the transportation and building sectors.
Sonam Velani is the Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Streetlife Ventures, a venture fund that invests at the intersection of cities and climate. She says that “U.S. cities have set strong targets.” Nevertheless, in order to progress, Velani often recalls the wise words of former Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto: you’ve got to remove the red tape and roll out the green carpet for more sustainable solutions.
For instance, Colorado’s General Assembly created an e-bike rebate program, which allowed cities such as Denver to incentivise residents to reduce gas vehicle trips. In 2022, this initiative cut 2,040 metric tons of carbon dioxide and saved $1 million in fuel and electricity costs, showcasing an effective mechanism for reducing transportation emissions.
But the U.S. needs to catch up to its peers for large-scale infrastructure projects to electrify significant parts of the transportation sector, such as railways and metro systems. Data gathered by New York University’s Marron Institute of Urban Management (Chart 4) shows that the cost of building subways in the U.S. tends, on average, to be three times that in other countries.
Chart 4: Average Cost/km Per Country
“Our subways are at the top of the league tables for the wrong reason – they are the most expensive in the world, by a mile!” says Velani, a longtime transit aficionado and New York City infrastructure specialist. For example, New York’s East Side Access tunnel project costed $3.5 billion for each new mile of track — seven times the average elsewhere in the world, with construction and consulting costs comprising 50% and 45% of the total costs, respectively.
Velani says, “Given the demand to decarbonise our transportation systems, expand our metros to underserved communities, and provide more options for residents, transit agencies need to move smarter and faster. This includes streamlining permitting processes and building in-house capabilities rather than outsourcing work to consultants because it will enable more efficient use of funds from the IRA and IIJA – it’s all about how far every dollar can go, figuratively and literally.”
Alongside, Velani suggests that transport agencies should develop design standards and create the capacity to construct components off-site to reduce repetitive work and allow multiple parts of the project to move forward in tandem.
“Once you build the subway, you have to make sure people enjoy riding the subway. That is part and parcel of the mode-shift conversation,” explains Velani. “Cities will benefit from developing an integrated payment system that factors in end-to-end journeys via different modes of transport, ultimately creating a seamless user experience across sustainable transportation modes.”
Green upskilling will be key to technological development and decarbonisation efforts
According to McKinsey & Company, the development of climate technologies is critical for countries to meet their net-zero challenges. Between 2019 and 2022, the United States saw strong growth in climatetech investments, adding $6–$8 billion of venture capital funding annually and attracting an average of 47% of all global climatetech venture funding.
For the U.S. to take advantage of net-zero economic opportunities by developing globally competitive climatetech solutions, particularly in the manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy, bridging the skills gaps will be critical. Nearly 40% of U.S. energy jobs are net-zero-aligned, and boosting U.S. productivity represents a $10 trillion opportunity in the era of energy transition.
However, LinkedIn’s latest report shows the U.S. lagging behind other auto manufacturing leaders in EV skills acquisition, with only 3.7% of auto workers (about half the U.K.’s percentage) possessing EV skills. Moreover, 13 million jobs in the U.S. are highly vulnerable to climate extremes and economic transition impacts. This highlights the urgency of advanced planning and retraining to ensure workers find new jobs in a net-zero economy.
Dr. Kamal Kapadia, co-founder and chief learning officer at Terra.do, says, ""as technology has evolved over time, so have the jobs, which calls for retraining and building new skilling. Given the pace at which we need to transition to a zero-carbon economy, and the high-skilled nature of green jobs like battery manufacturing and carbon accounting, it will be important for industry to define roles and the skills needed so educational institutions and programs can develop the right training”.
The U.S. has sought to unlock investments in clean energy technologies and improve economic competitiveness in sectors such as EV and battery manufacturing through the IRA and BIL. Other countries and regions have implemented similar measures and put forward plans to improve their labor productivity for a net-zero economy. Given that 72% of U.S. commuting zones rich in pollution-intensive jobs are also rich in green jobs, the IMF has found that climate literacy and upskilling are crucial to enabling workers to transition into green jobs (Chart 5).
Chart 5: Proximity of Green and Polluting Jobs
Kapadia adds that, for these reasons, “the government needs to promote basic climate literacy across the economy and provide incentives so companies can upskill their workers. A skilled and climate-literate workforce will enable U.S. companies to attract the capital needed to build and implement decarbonisation solutions”.","april 2021   united states announce plan reduce greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emission 50–52 % 2005 level achieve net - zero emission 2050   critical component president biden ’s plan implement target include pass inflation reduction act ( ira ) bipartisan infrastructure law ( bil bil )   expect unlock investment clean energy technology improve u   economic competitiveness   innovation   industrial productivity

23645,https://grist.org/energy/joe-biden-ethanol-biofuels/,2021-02-24 11:15:24,Tom Philpott,"This story was originally published by Mother Jones and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.
President Joe Biden campaigned on an ambitious plan to tackle climate change with a “clean energy revolution,” including incentives to phase out gas-powered cars in favor of electric ones. The growing consensus among climate experts is that to slash carbon emissions quickly enough, we need to eliminate as much air-fouling combustion as possible while expanding wind and solar energy to power the grid. But a key aspect of Biden’s agenda contradicts this push: He’s vowed to “promote ethanol and the next generation of biofuels,” declaring them “vital to the future of rural America — and the climate.” Biden tapped longtime ethanol champion Tom Vilsack — former governor of Iowa, the fuel’s Saudi Arabia — to run the Department of Agriculture, a post he held under former President Barack Obama.
In doing so, Biden is doubling down on a bad idea that has flourished since the days of President George W. Bush. Shortly before declaring the nation “addicted to oil” in 2006, Bush pushed through a bipartisan law with a “renewable fuel standard” that effectively mandated a dramatic ramp-up in corn ethanol production. As a result, the portion of the massive U.S. corn crop devoted to the fuel rose from 11 percent in 2004 to 30 percent in 2015, where it has held steady. Barack Obama and Donald Trump both joined the pro-ethanol presidential chorus.
Today, corn-based ethanol has replaced about 10 percent of “climate change causing petroleum” at the gas station, boasts the website of the American Coalition for Ethanol, the industry’s main lobbying group, adding that ethanol production “supports 360,000 jobs in rural communities.”
Even though it was once embraced by some environmentalists, ethanol has turned out to be much better at providing common ground for wildly disparate presidents than cutting greenhouse gas emissions. For starters, corn does a lousy job of turning the sun into fuel. Plants store just 1 percent of the solar energy they receive via photosynthesis, notes Mark Jacobson, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford. A solar panel, by contrast, is 20 percent efficient. “So you put a solar panel over the same land, you get 20 times more energy,” Jacobson says — energy that could go toward a grid to power electric cars.
But Bush’s federal ethanol mandate tied us to internal combustion engines, which spew a range of disease-causing toxins along with heat-trapping carbon dioxide. Electric engines not only avoid tailgate fumes, they’re also much more efficient. According to the Department of Energy, conventional vehicles convert at most 30 percent of the energy stored in liquid fuel to horsepower; the rest leaks out, mostly as heat. Electric-powered vehicles, meanwhile, convert at least 60 percent of energy expended to locomotion.
Meanwhile, EV battery technology is improving rapidly, meaning cheaper electric cars with longer ranges between plug-ins — solving two problems that have held back electric car sales for years. From 2010 to 2020, battery prices plunged 89 percent. By 2023, according to a projection by Car and Driver, electric vehicles will be no more expensive than their fuel-burning competitors.
In short, maintaining ethanol production at current levels means propping up a wildly energy-wasting technology. For that to make sense as climate policy — the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that we need to cut global carbon emissions by 45 percent by 2030 to avert catastrophe — ethanol would have to be magical stuff indeed.
Spoiler: It’s not. From a greenhouse gas emissions perspective, the renewable fuel standard has been a bust, says Jason Hill, a professor at the University of Minnesota’s Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering. By displacing petroleum, the ethanol mandate made conventional gasoline cheaper, which made people drive more while buying less-fuel-efficient vehicles. As a result, Hill and two colleagues found in a 2016 paper, the net effect of the law was to increase greenhouse gas emissions from cars by about 22 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, equivalent to the output of nearly six coal-fired power plants.
The environmental footprint of industrial-scale corn farming is another stain on ethanol’s claim to be a green fuel. Corn typically covers about 90 million acres of farmland — an area nearly the size of California. Fertilizing the crop emits nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon, as well as nitrate pollution that fouls water from the upper Midwest to the Gulf of Mexico, where it generates a low-oxygen dead zone larger than Connecticut. Hill and his colleagues have found that nitrogen fertilizer applied to corn also results in emissions of ammonia, a powerful pollutant, that have been associated with a staggering 4,300 premature deaths yearly in the United States.
But what about the 360,000 jobs in rural communities supposedly supported by the ethanol industry? According to David Swenson, a researcher at Iowa State University’s Department of Economics, that’s more industry spin. To reach that number, ethanol boosters include a portion of all corn farmers and their employees in their calculations. But corn was a wildly overproduced crop when ethanol took off in the early 2000s. The ethanol boom mostly created a market for surplus corn, not new jobs. Swenson estimates the ethanol industry is directly responsible for only about 47,000 jobs, a tiny fraction of rural employment, even in corn-heavy states like Iowa. Meanwhile, the Energy Department reported in 2017 that solar energy alone employs more Americans than oil, coal, and gas combined.","story originally publish mother jones reproduce part climate desk collaboration

33523,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-09-19/will-newsom-gas-plan-really-prevent-pricespikes,2024-09-19 10:00:08,"Russ Mitchell, Russ Mitchell Staff, www.latimes.com, russ-mitchell","If you drive a car or pickup truck in California, you care about the price of gasoline — especially if it spikes toward $7 a gallon, as it did in September 2022.
Perhaps you’ve heard that Gov. Gavin Newsom has called a special session of the Legislature to consider a law meant to prevent such price spikes. It would allow the state to mandate minimum supplies of gasoline be stored at California-based refineries. The special session starts with hearings this week on a bill to pave the way for the reserve. Here’s a primer on the issue:
What is the Newsom plan?
If the Legislature passes the minimum inventory bill, refineries in California could be required to keep extra gasoline on hand, so when a refinery shuts down for planned maintenance or an unplanned problem, prices at the pump won’t spike. That’s the theory anyway. The California Energy Commission would be charged with deciding whether a reserve should be created and how big it must be.
Where would this gasoline be stored?
It depends on how big a cushion the state might mandate. Spare capacity in existing storage tanks might suffice. Additional storage tanks might need to be built, according to the industry, and they might run about $35 million a tank. The state’s recently created Division of Petroleum Market Oversight reports that California refineries typically keep 15 days or more supply on hand, which tends to shrink by several days when a refinery shuts down for maintenance.
Who would pay the costs of a gasoline reserve?
The refinery companies.
How much?
Yet to be determined.
Won’t those costs be passed along to consumers?
Most likely, although they’d be more evenly spread throughout the year. How much money, and how it would compare to temporary price spikes, can’t be estimated until the state decides how big the gasoline reserve would be and how it would be managed.
Is there more to the plan?
Yes. The law would allow the energy commission to “impose requirements” for minimum inventory not just for gasoline, but also for feedstocks and blending components used to create the final gasoline product. It also would require refineries to seek permission to reduce the mandated inventory level in times of high demand.
The commission could impose civil penalties up to $1 million a day for noncompliance. Refiners would be required to produce evidence that any production losses during maintenance won’t adversely affect the transportation fuel market in California.
What is the California Energy Commission?
The commission was created as a policy and planning agency in 1975 as a response to the 1970s energy crisis. For decades it’s served as the state’s go-to source for energy statistics and analysis. The state Assembly in recent years has granted the commission more investigatory and regulatory power, including state management of the electric vehicle public charging system. The Division of Petroleum Market Oversight, created in 2023, sits under the energy commission’s umbrella and is headed by a lawyer with deep experience in antitrust law.
Does the commission have any experience in oil refinery management?
It appears to be a work in progress. In an email, Siva Gunda, the commission’s vice chair, wrote, “The California Energy Commission has more than four decades of experience with the petroleum industry as part of our responsibilities under the Petroleum Industry Information Reporting Act. Our longstanding expertise has been further strengthened by new tools and transparency provided by the [2023] California Gas Price Gouging and Transparency Law. Contracts with outside experts further enhance our capabilities.”
The new legislation would create an expert committee with six members, who “shall either hold an academic position in, or demonstrate expertise of, economics or business operations of the transportation fuels market.” However, anyone who has worked in the oil and gas industry for the previous 12 months would be ineligible to sit on the commission.
What does the industry have to say?
“California politicians and regulators do not have the technical expertise to be micro-managing refinery maintenance and construction projects or setting fuel inventory mandates for the private sector,” said Susan Grissom, chief analyst for the trade group American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, via email. “In fact, this legislation would disqualify those with real-world experience from providing any of this direction. This type of intervention from Sacramento is willfully negligent and much more likely to compromise safety and harm the regional fuel supply chain than help.”
Any response to that from the governor?
Through a spokesman, Gov. Newsom and his senior climate advisor, Lauren Sanchez, declined to comment.
How about from industry experts?
Severin Borenstein, a UC Berkeley professor who heads the Energy Institute at Haas, said an inventory mandate could end up shaving price spikes a bit, but his research shows the main problem occurs closer to the retail level, where pricing remains opaque. The state has been looking into what Borenstein calls this “mystery surcharge” but has reached no conclusions.
The governors of Arizona and Nevada have come out against the plan. Why?
The vast majority of gasoline in Arizona and Nevada is pumped in by pipeline from California, New Mexico and Texas. Gov. Katie Hobbs of Arizona, a Democrat, and Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, sent a joint letter to Newsom that reads in part: “Despite ongoing conversations about the root causes of rising fuel costs, it is evident that increased regulatory burdens on refiners and forced supply shortages will result in higher costs for consumers in all of our states. With both of our states reliant on California pipelines for significant amounts of our fuel, these looming cost increases and supply shortages are of tremendous concern to Arizona and Nevada.”
In a letter to the energy commission, the Arizona Petroleum Marketers Assn. said, “If refiners are required to prioritize California’s reserve requirements, it could lead to reduced fuel shipments to Arizona, creating supply shortages and potentially leading to fuel scarcity in our state. This could severely impact the availability of fuel in Arizona, causing widespread disruption.”
Has any state tried inventory controls before?
No. California is setting the pace. In 2023, Australia created a gasoline reserve. Unlike the California plan, the reserve was created for geopolitical strategic reasons. The country imports more than 90% of its gasoline. Although private industry pays most of the reserve’s cost, Australia has pitched in with hundred of millions in government funding.
What about the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve?
That’s a crude oil reserve, not gasoline. Created in response to the 1970s energy crisis, the reserve can store up to 700 million barrels of oil, most of it in underground salt caverns. Although it is intended as a cushion during war or other major emergency, presidents sometimes release reserve oil to soften retail gasoline prices.
The U.S. did maintain an emergency gasoline supply, the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve. It was created in 2014 in response to Hurricane Sandy, which severely damaged two refineries and caused 40 fuel terminals to shut down. But the reserve was recently depleted, with no plans for renewal.
When would the California gasoline reserve be created?
Not in time for any price spikes in the fall. If the government moves with unusual dispatch, it’s possible the rules and regulations could be in place by the end of next year.","drive car pickup truck california   care price gasoline — especially spike toward $ 7 gallon   september 2022

34725,https://reason.com/2024/09/04/kamala-harris-is-right-to-back-away-from-an-electric-vehicle-mandate/,2024-09-04 19:15:41,"Joe Lancaster, Jacob Sullum, Kevin Garcia-Galindo, C.J. Ciaramella","Since entering the race as the designated Democratic candidate for president, Vice President Kamala Harris has seemingly walked back some of her previous positions. In the latest example, Harris has apparently abandoned support for federal rules that would mandate the production of electric vehicles (E.V.s).
""In a lengthy 'fact-check' email last week that covered several issues, a campaign spokesperson included a line saying that Harris 'does not support an electric vehicle mandate,'"" report Alex Thompson and Ben Geman of Axios, ""suggesting she changed her previous position, without elaborating.""
As a U.S. senator, Harris co-sponsored the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act of 2019, establishing ""a schedule for increasing the percentage of zero-emission vehicles a vehicle manufacturer delivers for sale,"" phasing out all other vehicles by 2040.
While the bill never passed, Harris doubled down on the proposal when she ran for president in 2019, pledging to implement federal rules that would require half of all new vehicles sold by 2030 to be zero-emission, increasing to 100 percent by 2035.
But when asked by Axios ""whether she would sign or veto a bill"" like the ones she previously supported, Harris' campaign ""declined to comment.""
This suggests that Harris is not only backing away from a position that she had previously supported, but one that President Joe Biden's administration put forward in new rules from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) earlier this year.
Some suggest that Harris' reasoning is nakedly political. ""Vice President Harris is lying about her supposed opposition to an EV mandate,"" Sen. Pete Ricketts (R–Neb.) said in a statement. ""This sudden reversal just months before the election is a pathetic and transparent attempt to distance herself from the unpopular EV mandates already being pushed by the Biden-Harris EPA.""
In fairness, Harris' reasoning probably is less ideological than political: Polling conducted by the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, an oil industry trade group, indicates that most Americans—including a majority of Republicans and independents and a plurality of Democrats—oppose bans on gas-powered cars. The poll further found that majorities in eight battleground states oppose the bans by healthy margins, including Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—most or all of which Harris must win to become president.
While a group representing the oil industry is hardly a neutral party, Pew Research Center found similar results in a poll conducted last year, in which 59 percent of Americans indicated that they opposed phasing out gas-burning cars.
Americans are also speaking with their dollars, as demand for fully electric vehicles has cooled in recent months. Automakers, recognizing this downturn, are reinvesting in hybrids, which they see as more palatable to drivers who may not be ready to swear off internal combustion engines altogether.
""Many of our hybrids in the U.S. are now more profitable than their non-hybrid equivalent,"" Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley said in May. ""We should stop talking about it as transitional technology.""
Hopefully Harris' about-face is sincere. Market demand indicates that Americans are not yet ready to embrace fully electric vehicles as their only option. Until they are, the industry should be free to use whatever technologies it can to most effectively move toward the goal of fewer carbon emissions.","since enter race designate democratic candidate president   vice president kamala harris seemingly walk back previous position   late example   harris apparently abandon support federal rule would mandate production electric vehicle ( e v )

36507,https://freebeacon.com/democrats/inside-kamala-harriss-plan-to-make-bidens-unpopular-ev-mandate-even-more-aggressive/,2024-07-24 15:00:53,Thomas Catenacci,"Vice President Kamala Harris, who has emerged as the presumptive 2024 Democratic nominee for president, favors a far more aggressive plan to mandate electric vehicles than even President Joe Biden, whose EV policies have seen declining popularity both in swing states and nationwide.
During her 2020 presidential campaign, Harris vowed to implement climate policies ensuring 50 percent of all new passenger vehicles sold are EVs by 2030 and 100 percent are EVs by 2035, an archived copy of her campaign website shows. She also backed a mandate requiring all new vehicle purchases for corporate fleets, transportation networks, and heavy-duty vehicles be electric by 2030.
Months after she announced in January 2019 that she would run for president, Harris also cosponsored the so-called Zero-Emission Vehicles Act, a bill that was later modified to include language mandating 43 percent of car sales are electric by 2027 and 100 percent are electric by 2035.
By comparison, Biden's administration has finalized multi-pollutant emission standards, which are expected to lead to 56 percent of light-duty car sales being battery-electric and another 13 percent being hybrid by 2032. Under the administration's finalized standards for heavy-duty vehicles, less than half of trucks produced in 2032 will be electric.
But Harris's plan to rapidly electrify the U.S. transportation sector—which was among the most radical plans offered by candidates in 2020—sheds light on how a possible Harris administration may approach EV-related policies and climate change more broadly. And it provides fresh material for the Trump campaign, which has already vigorously attacked Biden's EV policies, to target in the months until the election.
""Kamala Harris' radical energy policies such as her EV mandate and the Green New Scam will hurt American workers, help China, and do virtually nothing to help the environment,"" Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told the Washington Free Beacon in a statement.
""President Trump advanced conservation and environmental stewardship while promoting economic growth for families across the country,"" Leavitt continued. ""America's energy agenda under President Trump produced affordable, reliable energy for consumers along with stable, high-paying jobs for small businesses—all while dropping U.S. carbon emissions to their lowest level in 25 years.""
A poll conducted earlier this month by Remington Research Group on behalf of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, which opposes EV mandates, found that 59 percent or more of likely voters in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin oppose bans on gas-powered cars in their states, which will likely determine the winner of the election.
Larger majorities in those states reported that a candidate's position on stopping bans on new gas cars would be an important factor in their vote.
""This new polling underscores what we have been hearing from the American people of all political stripes for months—that they do not want the government banning gas cars, mandating electric vehicles or imposing regulations that restrict access to the types of cars that best meet a family's needs and budget,"" American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers president Chet Thompson said at the time.
Forty-four percent of Americans, meanwhile, said they would consider purchasing an EV, down from 55 percent compared with last year, according to a March poll conducted by Gallup.
Overall, between January and March, just 9.3 percent of light-duty vehicles sold in the United States were either plug-in hybrid or battery-electric, a decline from 10.2 percent in the final quarter of 2023, according to data released earlier this month by the auto industry association Alliance for Automotive Innovation. Battery-electric sales dropped nearly 1 percentage point year-over-year, the data showed.
At the same time, major automakers—including General Motors, Ford, and Volkswagen—have also announced plans to substantially scale back EV production amid the considerable economic roadblocks facing the sector.
Automakers lose around $6,000 on every single EV they sell for $50,000, a March study conducted by Boston Consulting Group concluded. The average EV transaction price is $56,371, nearly $8,000 more than the average transaction price of gas-powered vehicles, according to the most recent Kelley Blue Book data.

National polling was conducted June 29 – July 2 by WPA Intelligence and measured likely voter sentiment around gas-car bans, EV mandates, and support for candidates who embrace such policies. Highlights of the polls are as follows:
Nationally, seven-in-ten likely voters oppose gas-car bans.
Overall: 70% oppose, 18% support
Republicans: 90% oppose, 6% support
Democrats: 49% oppose, 31% support
Independents: 71% oppose, 20% support
Almost two-thirds of voters, nationally, are less likely to vote for a candidate who supports gas-car bans.
Overall: 64% less likely, 16% more likely
Republicans: 88% less likely, 5% more likely
Democrats: 41% less likely, 27% more likely
Independents: 65% less likely, 16% more likely
More than 60% of voters are concerned they will be unable to buy the car of their choice in the next decade.
National: 37% very concerned, 25% somewhat concerned, 18% not too concerned, 13% not concerned at all
The battleground state polling — fielded in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin between June 29 – July 1 — was conducted by Remington Research Group and measured likely voter sentiment around gas-car bans, EV mandates, and support for candidates who embrace such policies.

AFPM President and CEO Chet Thompson issued the following statement on the new polling:
“This new polling underscores what we have been hearing from the American people of all political stripes for months—that they do not want the government banning gas cars, mandating electric vehicles or imposing regulations that restrict access to the types of cars that best meet a family’s needs and budget.
“Elected officials should take note that the American people care about this issue and are watching to see whether Congress will stand up and overturn EPA’s regulation banning the sale of most new gas cars.” — Chet Thompson, AFPM President and CEO

40270,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/1451207/critics-claim-epa-new-emission-standards-will-end-gasoline-vehicles/,2023-04-14 12:07:08,"Washington Examiner, www.facebook.com","(The Center Square) – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday announced new proposed federal vehicle emissions standards critics claim will “effectively ban gasoline and diesel vehicles” while making the U.S. dependent on China.
The EPA proposal of light and heavy-duty vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards is for model years 2027-2032. The EPA projects that its proposal could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 56% by 2032 and help increase electric vehicle light-duty sales by 67% by 2032.
“By proposing the most ambitious pollution standards ever for cars and trucks, we are delivering on the Biden-Harris Administration’s promise to protect people and the planet, securing critical reductions in dangerous air and climate pollution and ensuring significant economic benefits like lower fuel and maintenance costs for families,” said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan, in a media release.
The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers said the EPA decision to “fixate on tailpipe emissions rather than full fuel and vehicle lifecycle is a huge error that will stymie investment and artificially cap the potential of carbon abatement for liquid fuels and vehicles on the road today.”
“EPA’s proposal to effectively ban gasoline and diesel vehicles is bad for consumers, the environment, our freedom of mobility and U.S. national security,” American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers’ President and CEO Chet Thompson said in a press release.
Henry Payne, auto columnist for The Detroit News, said the Biden Administration is trying to radically transform the auto energy sector.
“A century after the alcohol Prohibition era, a second Temperance Movement has formed to ban carbon-emitting products as immoral,” Payne said in an email to The Center Square. “Popular consumer items like incandescent light bulbs, gas stoves, and gas cars are targeted. The effects are already being felt as Dodge has discontinued its successful Challenger and Daytona cars, and taxpayers are transferring $7,500 to wealthier Americans to buy expensive EVs [electric vehicles].”
Payne continued: “The Biden Administration is radically transforming auto/energy sectors in a comprehensive effort to eliminate fossil fuel use. The effort appears blind to the fact that China is championing global EV adoption because they are the Saudis of battery minerals. The U.S. spent 50 years becoming energy independent and is now poised to become dependent on China for its energy sector production.”
The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers also raised concerns about being dependent on China for EVs.
“It’s unconscionable that the Administration would propose this knowing full well that China controls 80% of global battery production capacity,” Thompson said. ” … and even with robust U.S. investment to fortify our own electric grid and grow our battery supply chains by a magnitude of 10, we will not come close to overtaking China’s dominant position and will be left more dependent and financially beholden to them as a result.”
Tim Carroll, EPA spokesperson, responded to the criticism
“These proposals do not mandate or ban specific technologies; they are performance-based standards for emissions, allowing each automaker to choose what set of emissions control technologies is best suited for their vehicle fleet to meet the standards,” Carroll said in an email to The Center Square. “EPA’s analysis indicates that one pathway the industry could take is to meet the standards by increasing the percentage of electric vehicles. The proposed standards are complementary with the direction the auto industry and consumers are already headed, given manufacturers’ public announcements of plans to transition their fleets to zero emission vehicles, which are supported by the historic financial incentives under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.”
The Michigan League of Conservation Voters applauded the EPA’s stance.
“Addressing the climate crisis will require a swift reduction in transportation pollution and the EPA’s proposed auto emissions standards are a strong step in the right direction,” said Bentley Johnson, Federal Government Affairs Director for Michigan League of Conservation Voters, in a media release. “The EPA must now strengthen the proposed rules to reduce harmful fossil fuel emissions, something that we know is critical for the health of frontline communities disproportionately impacted by pollution sources like heavy-duty diesel trucks in neighborhoods along shipping routes. These stronger rules – combined with federal clean energy investments – will help Michigan’s automakers go further and faster toward a zero emissions future while growing jobs and opportunity in the transportation sector.”","( center square ) – u   environmental protection agency thursday announce new propose federal vehicle emission standard critic claim "" effectively ban gasoline diesel vehicle "" make u   dependent china

57569,https://www.minnpost.com/greater-minnesota/2021/08/minnesota-lawmakers-look-to-low-carbon-fuel-standards-as-a-way-to-address-transportation-emissions/,2021-08-24 15:41:51,"Walker Orenstein, Ana Radelat, Rae Katherine Eighmey, Mark Olalde, Peter Callaghan, Michael Nolan, Britt Robson","Minnesota lawmakers are considering a new policy meant to slash carbon emissions from the transportation sector, the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the state.
Known nationally as a low-carbon fuel standard and in Minnesota as the “Future Fuels Act,” a version of the legislation has been adopted in California, Washington and Oregon but nowhere outside of the West Coast. It is meant to gradually make transportation fuels cleaner, helping the state meet goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in an area that has been difficult to scrub of air pollution that contributes to the climate crisis.
Unlike the Clean Cars regulations — a controversial mandate from Gov. Tim Walz’s administration that requires auto manufacturers provide more electric vehicles for sale in Minnesota — the low-carbon fuel standard is noteworthy for its broader, though not universal, political support. Democrats are widely in favor of it, and some Republicans are open to the concept. It has the backing of pro-EV interest groups, but also ethanol producers who see it as a key policy to sustain corn growers and rural refineries in the biofuels industry.
While the policy didn’t pass the Legislature during its 2021 regular session, it’s likely to be a focus of lawmakers who write environmental policy when they convene again in 2022.
How the fuel standard would work
The low-carbon fuel standard was pioneered by California, which adopted a version of the policy in 2011 and has updated it periodically since. More recently, Oregon and Washington have implemented a low-carbon fuel standard, and other states, including Colorado, New York and New Mexico are considering the idea.
The fuel standard bill introduced in Minnesota would require a 20 percent reduction in the “aggregate carbon intensity” of transportation fuel supplied to the state by the end of 2035. The intensity measure takes into account more than emissions from a tailpipe. Pollution from electricity generation for EVs, or producing crops for biofuels, is counted, for instance.
The state Department of Commerce would set benchmarks to ensure the carbon intensity from the fuels is dropping steadily before 2035. Tim Sexton, chief sustainability officer at the state Department of Transportation, estimated a low-carbon fuels policy could reduce carbon emissions by more than four million tons per year by 2030.
The transportation sector is Minnesota’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, emitting slightly more than 40 million tons of carbon in 2018, according to state officials. The state is not on pace to meet goals for a 30 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 set out in the Next Generation Energy Act passed in 2007.
A comprehensive United Nations report on human-caused climate change released in early August says the globe is probably locked in to warming above dangerous levels most nations have sought to avoid, but even worse extreme heat, drought and severe weather episodes are in store without a quick and drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
Under the low-carbon fuel standard bill, each supplier of fuel — such as ethanol, gasoline, electricity and natural gas — would be assigned a score representing the total “life cycle” greenhouse gas output of their product. The legislation would then set up a cap-and-trade system of “clean fuel credits” that fuel providers would have to buy and trade. Suppliers who meet state pollution benchmarks would earn credits, and those who fail to meet standards would need to buy those credits to make up their deficit. That money could then pay for efforts to advance cleaner fuels.
Some of the details of the program would be filled in by Commerce officials.
The policy was developed over more than two years by the Great Plains Institute, a Minneapolis nonprofit focused on energy use and climate change. The organization says it worked with more than 30 organizations on creating an outline of legislation geared toward midwestern states.
Brendan Jordan, a vice president at GPI who oversees transportation and fuels issues, said the policy is “technology neutral,” meaning it doesn’t mandate or explicitly favor one type of fuel, such as EVs, but instead nudges all fuels to get cleaner over time and rewards those who can meet pollution standards.
Focusing on all fuels is helpful, Jordan said, because even if the country shifts to EVs in the next 10 to 15 years, the state needs to reduce carbon emissions from existing fuels in the meantime.
“If all you have is an EV strategy you’re saying ‘that’s fine we’ll just accept all those emissions,'” Jordan said.
Biofuels producers support the legislation
Walz’s Clean Cars initiative, adopted by the administration without need for legislative approval, is supported by many Democrats and environmental groups as a way to reduce transportation emissions and boost the EV industry. But it has also drawn fierce opposition from elected Republicans, as well as the oil and biofuels industry, who saw the policy as favorable only to EVs. The low-carbon fuel standard, by contrast, has wider backing.
The measure was sponsored in the House by Rep. Todd Lippert, a Northfield Democrat, and in the Senate by Sen. Dave Senjem, a Republican from Rochester. Ethanol and biodiesel trade groups support the low-carbon fuel standard as well.
In a March letter to lawmakers, Brian Jennings, CEO of the American Coalition for Ethanol, said the legislation can lead to more use of E15 — and even higher blends of ethanol and gasoline. “Since California enacted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in 2011, demand for E85 has quadrupled and the state is in the process of allowing E15,” Jennings said.
While the climate impact of biofuels is hotly debated, and some researchers argue the fuels increase carbon emissions, ethanol is traditionally considered carbon neutral by the government. Either way, supporters of the Future Fuels policy say it requires biofuels to become cleaner.
The legislation would also “reward farmers” who use climate-friendly practices to reduce carbon intensity of corn ethanol, Jennings said. The ethanol coalition cited research in partnership with the Great Plains Institute saying reducing carbon intensity of transportation fuel 15 percent between 2021 to 2030 would generate about $250 million in economic activity each year for biofuel producers and farmers.
Geoff Cooper, CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, said in a letter the organization “sees a strong role for biofuels in making the Future Fuels Act a success.” Walz’s Council on Biofuels, convened in 2020 to help boost the industry during a pandemic-induced slump, recommended the Legislature adopt a low-carbon fuel standard.
The policy is also supported by General Motors, EV trade groups, and some environmental organizations like Fresh Energy and the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Lippert, the Northfield Democrat, said biofuels producers “can see themselves in this bill” and can advance innovations in the industry. But the legislation will ultimately “drive electrification in the transportation sector, too,” Lippert said. California, for example, has used money from their program’s credit market to pay for charging infrastructure and EV rebates.
“That’s a key thing we need to do to meet our climate goals and act as quickly as we can with climate change,” he said.
Lippert said he’d prefer a “more aggressive” goal for reducing emissions through a fuels standard, especially in light of the U.N. climate report.
Concerns about costs, controls
The Future Fuels Act does not have universal backing, however. Several House Republicans were skeptical of the legislation during hearings at the Legislature earlier this year. Rep. Barb Haley, R-Red Wing, said she was worried about the potential for increased gas prices. Oregon reported a reduction of 5.3 million metric tons of greenhouse gases from its low-carbon fuels program between 2016 and 2020, but also reported an estimated increase of 3.71 cents per gallon of E10.
Rep. Eric Lucero, R-Dayton, said he was concerned about leaving key policy details up to state agencies. And Rep. Spencer Igo, R-Grand Rapids, said he worried policies that advance biofuels and EVs would interfere with constituents who enjoy driving older cars or who like to ride four wheelers or snowmobiles.
“Having to buy new motors or new vehicles is not what they want to do,” Igo said. “They want to drive their 1990s F-150s that they can work on in their driveway. And I’m really afraid that a mandate like this policy would take that away from them.”
Peter Wagenius, legislative and political director for the Sierra Club’s North Star chapter, said during a March hearing that biofuels should have only a limited future supplying heavier vehicles with no electric alternatives since they pollute more than electricity right now “and they always will.”
Electric cars are quickly becoming more popular and technology is passing biofuels by, Wagenius said, and there is no need to “bureaucratize” EVs with a complex fuel standard unless it’s aimed largely at paying for charging stations and electric car rebates or incentives. Huge corn crops also pollute water and destroy pollinator habitat and the carbon-emission reductions from biofuels are overstated, Wagenius said.
The Sierra Club was neutral on the bill, however, saying it was better than mandating E15 blends in the state, as some lawmakers have considered.
While the DFL-led House passed the low-carbon fuel standard, it stalled in the Republican-led Senate. Senjem, the Rochester Republican who sponsored the measure, said the policy is “intriguing” and deserves more consideration. But he said senators ran out of time to properly vet it during a busy and complicated legislative session.
Senjem, who chairs the Senate’s Energy and Utilities Finance and Policy Committee, said he plans to give the bill a hearing in the 2022 legislative session, but said the complicated legislation could use some tweaking. Even though he expressed skepticism of credit trading schemes and of clean-fuels mandates more generally, Senjem said his support for biofuels was one reason he was interested. “We represent a lot of agriculture,” Senjem said of Senate Republicans. “If this is good for agriculture it’s probably something that’s going to be attractive to us.”","minnesota lawmaker consider new policy mean slash carbon emission transportation sector   single big source greenhouse gas emission state

The new rules, which take effect for model years 2027 through 2032, will avoid up to 1 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions over the next three decades and provide $13 billion in net benefits in the form of fewer hospital visits, lost work days and deaths, the EPA said. The new standards will especially benefit an estimated 72 million people in the United States who live near freight routes used by trucks and other heavy vehicles and bear a disproportionate burden of dangerous air pollution, the agency said.
“Heavy-duty vehicles are essential for moving goods and services throughout our country, keeping our economy moving. They’re also significant contributors to pollution from the transportation sector — emissions that are fueling climate change and creating poor air quality in too many American communities,'' EPA Administrator Michael Regan said.
""Reducing emissions from our heavy-duty vehicles means cleaner air and less pollution. It means safer and more vibrant communities. It means lower fuel and maintenance costs for truck owners and operators. And it means healthier Americans,'' Regan said.
The new rules for heavy trucks and buses come a week after the EPA announced new automobile emissions standards for passenger vehicles. Those rules relax initial tailpipe limits proposed last year but get close to the same strict standards set out by the EPA for model year 2032.
The auto industry could meet the limits if 56% of new passenger vehicle sales are electric by 2032, along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, the EPA said.
The rule for trucks is more complex, with a range of electric-vehicle or other non-traditional sales projected, depending on the type of vehicle and use, the agency said. For instance, 30% of “heavy-heavy-duty vocational” trucks would need to be zero-emission by 2032, the EPA said, while 40% of short-haul “day cabs” would need be zero emission vehicles.
The new rules for cars and trucks come as sales of EVs, which are needed to meet both standards, have begun to slow. The auto industry cited lower sales growth in objecting to the EPA’s preferred standards unveiled last April for passenger vehicles, a key part of President Joe Biden's ambitious plan to cut planet-warming emissions.
“Our Clean Trucks plan works in tandem with President Biden’s unprecedented investments in America and delivers on this administration’s commitment to tackling climate change while advancing environmental justice,'' Regan said.
The new rule will provide greater certainty for the industry, while supporting U.S. manufacturing jobs in advanced vehicle technologies, Regan said. Over the next decade, the standards “will set the U.S. heavy-duty sector on a trajectory for sustained growth,'' he said.
Industry groups strongly disagreed. They lambasted the new standards as unreachable with current electric-vehicle technology and complained about a lack of EV charging stations and power grid capacity limits.
The American Trucking Associations and the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, which represent large swaths of the industry, predicted supply chain failures and said that smaller independent firms would likely hang onto older diesel trucks that spew more pollution, running counter to the EPA’s goals.
The new limits lower zero-emission sales rates proposed for the 2027 through 2029 model years but require higher sales later, resulting in a practical mandate for electric and hydrogen-powered trucks, the trucking associations said in a statement. The EPA rule limits choices for trucks and buses to unproven technology, the group said.
“The post-2030 targets remain entirely unachievable,” said Chris Spear, the trucking group's CEO. “Any regulation that fails to account for the operational realities of trucking will set the industry and America’s supply chain up for failure.”
Todd Spencer, president of the independent drivers association, which represents small trucking companies, said the Democratic administration “seems dead-set on regulating every local mom-and-pop business out of existence with its flurry of unworkable environmental mandates.”
The American Petroleum Institute, the top lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, said in a joint statement with the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers that the new rule “is yet another example of the Biden administration’s whole-of-government effort to eliminate choices for American consumers, businesses and industries.''
The rule relies principally on zero-emission vehicles and “disincentivizes the development of other fuel-based technologies — including American-made renewable diesel — that are working in today’s heavy-duty fleet to reduce emissions,'' the groups said.
They called for the rule to be overturned by Congress but said they are prepared to challenge it in court.
Regan said the EPA crafted the limits to give truck owners a choice of powertrains including advanced combustion vehicles, hybrids and electric and hydrogen fuel cells.
“There’s a list of options that truck drivers, owners and operators can choose from ... while we (do) not sacrifice the very stringent environmental goals that we have set,” he told reporters Thursday.
The EPA calculated that new trucks would save operators a total of $3.5 billion in fuel and other costs from 2027 to 2032, paying for themselves in two to four years. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act also provides tax credits that subsidize the purchase price of new electric vehicles, Regan said.
The new emissions limits will bring immediate health benefits, especially in communities burdened by heavy truck traffic, said Harold Wimmer, CEO of the American Lung Association.
“Transportation is the largest source of pollution driving climate change,” he said in a statement. “These strong standards that will help drive toward a zero-emission future for trucks, buses and other heavy-duty vehicles are a critical part of the solution.”
Margo Oge, a former director of the EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality, said medium and heavy diesel trucks make up less than 6% of vehicles on the road “but spew more than half the smog and soot Americans breathe"" and contribute to global warming. The EPA standards “are a big step in the right direction to fight climate change and help us breathe cleaner air,” she said.","environmental protection agency friday set strict emission standard heavy - duty truck   bus large vehicle   action official say help clean nation 's large source planet - warm greenhouse gas

The new rule slows implementation of the stricter pollution standards initially proposed by the EPA, but eventually ramps up to nearly reach the agency's preferred standards by 2032. The story continues as originally published below:
-------------------------------------------
In February, ads airing in multiple states claimed President Joe Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency is “rushing” to ban new gas-powered cars in the United States in order to force people to buy electric vehicles. The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), a trade association representing fuel manufacturers, paid for the ads.
The AFPM said on Feb. 12 that the ads were launched to inform people in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona, Ohio, Montana and the Washington, D.C. area about the Biden administration’s alleged efforts to ban new gas, diesel, traditional hybrid and flex-fuel vehicles from the U.S. market.
Several VERIFY readers who saw the ads, including Deb and Rachel, asked if the Biden administration is really trying to ban gas-powered vehicles in the U.S.
THE QUESTION
Is the Biden administration banning gas-powered vehicles in the U.S.?
THE SOURCES
THE ANSWER
No, the Biden administration is not banning gas-powered vehicles in the U.S. The EPA has proposed strict automobile pollution limits that would require up to two-thirds of new passenger cars and trucks sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2032.

WHAT WE FOUND
The Biden administration is not banning gas-powered vehicles in the U.S. Instead, the EPA has proposed strict automobile pollution limits that would require up to two-thirds of new passenger cars and trucks sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2032. These standards, which the agency says are vital to slowing climate change, will only apply to new cars manufactured in model year 2027 and beyond, not ones currently on the roads.
On April 12, 2023, the EPA proposed new federal vehicle emissions standards for light-duty, medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles manufactured for the 2027 through 2032 model years to “significantly reduce climate and other harmful air pollution.” The proposed standards would set the strictest tailpipe pollution limits the EPA has imposed in more than 40 years and call for far more new EV sales than the auto industry agreed to in 2021.
However, the EPA is not banning gas-powered vehicles. The proposed standards do not mandate or “target” the use of a specific technology, such as EVs, and it would not require automakers to boost electric vehicle sales directly. Instead, it sets emissions limits and allows automakers to choose how to meet them.
According to an October 2023 article published by RMI, the EPA rule does not outlaw diesel and petrol (gas) vehicle sales. RMI is an independent, non-partisan, nonprofit focused on accelerating the transition to a clean energy future. Car manufacturers must meet average emissions limits across their entire product line, and RMI says the sale of gas-powered vehicles will not stop in 2027.
The EPA’s proposal is currently in an interagency review process. A final ruling is expected to come sometime this spring.
Under the proposed standards, RMI says that automakers must document that their new product line does not exceed the average tailpipe emission limit. Automakers will also have a series of options to ensure their new vehicles meet the EPA requirements starting in 2027. These options include implementing particulate filters to reduce particulate matter (PM) emissions and adopting other technology improvements to reduce the carbon dioxide (CO2) from gas and diesel-powered vehicles.
If automakers comply with the proposed standards, the EPA projects that at least 60 percent of new passenger vehicles sold in the U.S. would be electric by 2030 and up to 67% by 2032. For slightly larger, medium-duty trucks, the EPA projects that 46% of new vehicle sales will be EVs in 2032.
The RMI says that drivers will not be subject to emissions checks or mandates under the proposed standards. The regulations indirectly affect consumers when they purchase a new vehicle starting in 2027, “as it will likely impact the type of vehicle that is available for purchase.”
“This policy impacts the point of sale and does not require any action by the consumer. In fact, tailpipe emission regulations are already in place today, and the proposed rules simply increase the stringency for vehicles manufactured in model 2027 and beyond,” RMI said.
Thousands of auto dealers have said they won’t be able to meet the EPA’s stringent goals. In November, nearly 4,000 dealerships of the nearly 17,000 franchised shops nationwide sent a letter to President Joe Biden, asking him to “tap the brakes” on the EPA proposal, referring to the rules as an “electric vehicle mandate.” House Republicans approved a bill in December to block the pollution limits and also called the rules a mandate.
Auto dealers sent Biden a second letter in January asking him to “hit the brakes” entirely, citing several factors that they say indicate slowing EV adoption. The signers said the supply of EVs on dealer lots is twice that of internal combustion engine vehicles, and that they won’t be able to sell EVs at the rate the regulations would require.
But sources familiar with the plan told the New York Times in February that the Biden administration intends to give car manufacturers more time to adopt the EPA’s requirements in an election-year concession to automakers and labor unions.","update ( 03/20/2024 )   biden administration announce new emission standard car truck march 20   new rule slow implementation strict pollution standard initially propose epa   eventually ramp nearly reach agency 's preferred standard 2032   story continue originally publish

Big Climate Tries to Censor Opponents
Progressives move to block TV ads opposing the Biden EV mandate.
By The Editorial Board,Wall Street Jounral, February 16, 2024:
If President Biden’s electric-vehicle mandate is as popular as progressives claim, why are they trying to censor critics who want to inform the public about the mandate’s costs?
That’s the story this week, after the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) launched ads in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona, Ohio and Montana to educate Americans about the Administration’s back-door EV mandate. Mr. Biden is “rushing to ban new gas-powered cars” and wants “to force you into an electric vehicle,” one ad says.
The Biden team doth protest. “There is no EV mandate,” a Biden campaign official declared. No? The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed greenhouse gas emissions standards that would effectively require that EVs make up two-thirds of auto maker sales by 2032. The standards will “accelerate the transition to electric vehicles,” EPA said.
EPA’s proposed emissions rules are so stringent that auto makers will be able to comply only by producing an increasing number of “zero-emission vehicles” or by buying regulatory credits from EV manufacturers like Tesla
. Americans shopping for a new car will have no choice but to buy an EV or pay a fortune for the few gas-powered cars still available.
Yet Mr. Biden and his allies don’t want voters to know that banning gas-powered cars is their end game. That’s why the progressive umbrella group Climate Power on Tuesday shot off a missive to broadcasters demanding that they pull the AFPM ads—or else. These “advertisements include obvious lies aimed at deceiving the public and must be pulled from the air immediately,” Climate Power chief operating officer Jill Shesol wrote. But who’s actually trying to deceive the public?
The letter cites a PolitiFact report claiming it is “wrong to say there is a ‘Biden mandate’ to replace gasoline-powered cars with [electric vehicles].” PolitiFact is a liberal opinion operation. Was it also wrong for the New York Times
last May to report that EPA’s proposed rule is “designed to ramp up sales of electric vehicles while ending the use of gasoline-powered cars”?
“The EPA does not have the authority to demand such a mandate,” the Climate Power letter says. Correct, which is why the EPA is using regulation to impose the de facto mandate. The Obama Administration similarly tried to force a transition to renewable power by setting unfeasible emissions standards for fossil-fuel power plants.
Climate Power warns local broadcasters that the Federal Communications Commission could pull their licenses if they continue broadcasting the ads. “Failure to prevent the airing of ‘false and misleading advertising’ may be ‘probative of an underlying abdication of licensee responsibility’ that can be cause for the loss of a station’s license,’” the letter says.
EDF Action on Tuesday also sent stations a letter claiming that the AFPM ad “appears to be a deliberate attempt to tarnish the politicians . . . who may support policies that reduce air pollution and save lives.” But President Biden isn’t trying to reduce air pollution or save lives, and the EPA rule doesn’t aim to do either.
Opponents of “cleaner alternatives,” the letter adds, “do not have the right to mislead voters and spread disinformation on public airwaves.” But they do have a First Amendment right to critique public policies that damage their livelihoods.

The near-finalized Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tailpipe emissions rule to mandate 67% of new vehicles sold by 2032 to be EVs drops this April. Last month, the administration doubled down on accelerating the forceful adoption of these non-gas alternatives. This week, however, the White House appeared to strike a slightly different tone on its mandate, per a New York Times report.

“In a concession to automakers and labor unions, the Biden administration intends to relax elements of one of its most ambitious strategies to combat climate change, limits on tailpipe emissions that are designed to get Americans to switch from gas-powered cars to electric vehicles, according to three people familiar with the plan,” the report claims. “Instead of essentially requiring automakers to rapidly ramp up sales of electric vehicles over the next few years, the administration would give car manufacturers more time, with a sharp increase in sales not required until after 2030, these people said. They asked to remain anonymous because the regulation has not been finalized.”
.But if you dare suggest that the White House is mandating the phase-out of internal-combustion-engine (ICE) vehicles, radical environmentalists will actively censor you.
The Wall Street Journal recently reported the progressive group Climate Power is demanding local TV broadcasters reject ads from the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM). Climate Power is a self-described “paid media operation” founded by leftist preservationist environmental groups like the Center for American Progress Action Fund, League of Conservation Voters, and Sierra Club.
Its Chief Operating Officer Jill Shesol threatened broadcasters in a letter not to air AFPM’s ads against Biden’s EV mandate, writing, “AFPM’s advertisements falsely state that “President Biden’s EPA is rushing to ban new gas-powered cars.” The ads ask viewers to “tell [President Biden] to stop his EPA’s car ban.” However, there is no pending federal “car ban,” and to claim otherwise is patently false and intentionally misleading.”
The letter continued and warned it would sic the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on them if they proceeded against their wishes: “You have a duty “to protect the public from false, misleading or deceptive advertising.” Failure to prevent the airing of “false and misleading advertising” maybe “probative of an underlying abdication of licensee responsibility” that can be cause for the loss of a station’s license.”
This is unhinged, aggressive behavior from climate alarmists. AFPM, however, has the First Amendment right to play these anti-EV ads and isn’t bowing to pressure from these bullies.
""The President has been clear since 2020 that he intends to use his agencies to eliminate sales of new gas cars,"" AFPM noted in a statement reported by Fox News. ""Tinkering with the near-term speed of implementation doesn't change the end game, which is banning new gas-powered cars.""
But it’s not just Biden’s EV mandate. Eighteen states and Washington, D.C., are now married to California’s net-zero vehicle rules to get rid of gas-powered cars by 2035.
One of the impacted states is my state, the Commonwealth of Virginia. Despite the aggressive push, just 56,000 EVs exist here. EV mandates are extremely unpopular in Old Dominion, too, with 57% of Virginians being opposed to remaining tethered to the Golden State’s rules.
Ahead of last year’s statewide elections, Governor Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) said only Virginians - not Sacramento - should choose their preferred car models. Youngkin said, “If you want to buy an electric vehicle, buy one; that's your decision - just don't drive too far. But most importantly, that's your decision, not California's and not the government's.”

Had they passed several bills in the General Assembly, they would have untethered us from these obtuse regulations. I sent this statement to our State Senate on behalf of Independent Women’s Voice last month, explaining, “Untethering Virginia from California’s emissions regulations and electric vehicle mandates is good policy. Virginians, like their fellow Americans, aren’t warming up to forced EV adoption. Phasing out sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 is an unworkable goal that presents risks to energy safety. Drivers are skeptical of purchasing EVs – citing range issues, high costs, and long charging times. That’s why Virginians should choose the best car for them and their families.”
Alas, Democrats who narrowly control the General Assembly ignored our concerns and killed the bills in question. They’re going to have to learn, ironically, from their California brethren that so-called climate action becomes unpopular when costs and utility bills go up.
EV proponents cannot gaslight their way to mandating EV acceptance and adoption. Why? The push to abandon reliable cars is not selling well with consumers.
And manufacturers aren’t falling for the illusion anymore. Ford announced its scaling down production of its F150 Lightning truck. Electric automaker Rivian is laying off 10% of its workforce. Hertz is selling a third of its global EV fleet - 20,000 vehicles - and bringing back “gas guzzlers.”

The Maine Board of Environmental Protection (BEP) turned down the so-called Advanced Clean Cars program after receiving overwhelming opposition from stakeholders and citizens. The proposed program would have closely mirrored regulations approved in California, mandating that at least 51% of new car purchases in the state be electric by 2028 and 82% be electric by 2032.
""The Maine Board of Environmental Protection received nearly 1,800 comments from the people of Maine and nearly 84% were not in favor of this EV mandate,"" Maine Senate Republican Leader Trey Stewart told Fox News Digital. ""Maine is far too rural with far too few charging stations, and many Mainers are also concerned about the reliability of these vehicles in our extreme cold-weather months.""
TRUMP CAMPAIGN RESPONDS IN FORCE AFTER BIDEN CRACKS DOWN ON GAS CARS, VOWS 'DAY ONE' REVERSAL
According to BEP filings, earlier this year, the state received a total of 1,783 public comment letters with just 287 supporting the Advanced Clean Cars rule. A whopping 1,496 letters were filed in opposition to the mandate.
Among the stakeholders who filed opposition letters were the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, the Maine Automobile Dealers Association and Democratic Maine Rep. Jared Golden, who represents a largely rural congressional district.
17 RETIRED MILITARY OFFICIALS RAISE ALARM ON BIDEN'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH
""Affordable transportation is a requirement, not a luxury, in rural Maine,"" Golden said in a social media post on X, formerly Twitter, following the vote. ""Regulations must recognize reality: California-style emissions standards would impose logistic and financial hurdles that Maine isn’t ready to clear. The state BEP made the right decision to reject them.""
While the Maine BEP was originally slated to vote on adopting the Advanced Clear Car Program in late December, a major windstorm caused widespread power outages statewide, forcing state offices to be closed and the agency's vote to be indefinitely delayed.
The agency ultimately proposed a slightly modified version of the EV mandate, pushing the start date from 2027 to 2028, and accepted a new round of comments from the public and stakeholders through early February.
130+ HOUSE, SENATE REPUBLICANS JOIN FORCES IN OPPOSITION OF BIDEN'S UPCOMING EV MANDATE
Critics of aggressive EV requirements warned that the Maine power grid is currently unequipped to handle the significantly increased demand and load that would be generated by widespread EV adoption. They also argued that power outages, triggered by storms like the December windstorm, could render large swaths of an electrified transportation sector useless.
According to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a group that represents major automakers, 5.8% of total car purchases in Maine last year were electric or plug-in hybrid. That figure is less than the national average of 9.3%.

Meanwhile, more than a dozen states have successfully adopted California's EV mandate regulations unveiled in August 2022. Under California's plan, 100% of all car purchases must be electric by 2035.

Led by Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the coalition filed a challenge against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, asking the court to declare the new rules unlawful. According to the filing, the EPA regulations impose ""unworkable emissions standards"" on passenger cars and medium-duty vehicles.
""Conservative attorneys general are slamming the brakes on President Biden’s radical green agenda that is using the weight of the federal government to force expensive EVs on families, workers and farmers,"" Coleman said in a statement to Fox News Digital.
""Even if Americans wanted to buy an electric car, we can’t afford them amid historic inflation,"" he continued. ""We’re taking President Biden’s EPA to court to block this latest big-government mandate and protect the free market.""
FEWER AMERICANS WANT TO BUY AN EV — EVEN AS BIDEN PUSHES FOR STRONGEST-EVER CLIMATE CHANGE RULES
In a joint announcement with the White House last month, the EPA issued the regulations, which are the most aggressive multipollutant emission standards ever finalized. Those standards were officially published Thursday, opening the door to legal challenges and congressional resolutions.
While the regulations target gas-powered vehicles, they are explicitly designed to push a wider, nationwide adoption of EVs and, to a lesser extent, hybrid cars. President Biden said after the rules were finalized, they would help ensure the U.S. meets his goal of EVs accounting for 50% of all new car sales in 2030.
MAINE REJECTS SWEEPING ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE IN BLOW TO GOVERNOR'S CLIMATE AGENDA
Under the standards, automakers will be forced to rapidly curb the emissions of greenhouse gases, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from new passenger cars, light trucks, and larger pickups and vans beginning in two years with model year 2027 vehicles. The EPA said the rules will help ""tackle the climate crisis"" by reducing the transportation sector's carbon dioxide emissions.
When the tailpipe emissions rules kick in, automakers will be compelled to increase production and sales of EVs, plug-in hybrids, traditional hybrids and fuel cell vehicles. Under one so-called ""low cost"" model, the EPA said automakers would be forced to ensure 56% of light-duty car sales are battery electric and another 13% are hybrid by 2032.
""Kentucky is an agriculture state, and EVs aren’t tough enough to keep up with our farmers,"" said Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell. ""We put a lot of miles on the Kentucky Department of Agriculture’s vehicles to serve rural communities, and we can’t stop on the side of the road to plug in. The Biden administration has it out for rural America, and I’m proud Kentucky is leading the fight to stop them.""
17 RETIRED MILITARY OFFICIALS RAISE ALARM ON BIDEN'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH
Joining Kentucky and West Virginia in the legal challenge filed Thursday are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.
The EPA's regulations have been heavily criticized by state officials, Republican and Democratic lawmakers, agriculture industry groups like the National Corn Growers Association and energy associations, such as the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute.
In 2023, 9.5% of new, light-duty vehicle sales were EVs, up from 7% in 2022 and 4.3% in 2021, according to data from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents major automakers. At the same time, EVs remain more expensive than traditional, gas-powered cars.

The EPA’s proposed standards are designed to restrict the sale of new gas-powered vehicles so as to effectively force the realization of its target of 67% of all new car sales being electric by 2032. The ultimate goal, of course, would be to end gas-powered vehicles entirely. As The New York Times reported last April, the EPA’s new rules “could put the nation on track to end sales of new gasoline-powered cars as soon as 2035.”
Of course, the Biden administration argues that the new EPA rules are needed to combat climate change. But as we and many others have repeatedly observed, EVs would have almost no impact on emissions levels while at the same time saddling Americans with a much more expensive and more limited vehicle.
In short, the reasoned and practical economic and scientifically sound objections don’t back up the Biden administration’s mad dash into green-dream dystopia.
But the Biden administration doesn’t want that message getting out to the American public and thereby delivering a dose of practical reality to its consumer-controlling agenda. Therefore, following the AFPM’s ad campaign, the Biden administration is calling foul via the leftist organization Climate Power.
In a letter sent to broadcasters in states where the AFPM is running its ad campaign, Climate Power ridiculously alleges that the “advertisements include obvious lies aimed at deceiving the public and must be pulled from the air immediately.” Furthermore, Climate Power warns that local broadcasters who don’t pull these ads risk having their licenses revoked by the Federal Communications Commission. The pretense? “Failure to prevent the airing of ‘false and misleading advertising’ may be ‘probative of an underlying abdication of licensee responsibility’ that can be cause for the loss of a station’s license.”
And what is supposedly “false and misleading” in AFPM’s ads? Well, according to Climate Power, which conveniently cites the Leftmedia outlet PolitiFact, it is “wrong to say there is a ‘Biden mandate’ to replace gasoline-powered cars with [electric vehicles].” The letter further observes, “The EPA does not have the authority to demand such a mandate.”
Yes, it is technically accurate to observe that the Biden administration, via the EPA, doesn’t have the power to mandate what vehicles people are allowed to buy. But that is a disingenuous dodge of the truth.
The issue is one of intent, which the Biden administration has made quite clear — to end the sale of fossil fuel-powered vehicles. The administration is acting toward this end by having the EPA impose its new and onerous tailpipe emissions regulations, which will effectively make gas-powered vehicles unaffordable for the vast majority of Americans. It’s a de facto mandate for EVs.
Meanwhile, the administration’s effort to engage in censorship of views that challenge its favored climate change narrative doesn’t stop with threatening local broadcasting stations. The White House recently teamed up with a leftist British online censorship advocacy group, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, in an effort to pressure Big Tech into censoring the so-called “New Denial” on climate change.
Hiding behind the claim of preventing “hate” and the dissemination of online “disinformation” regarding climate change, the CCDH is pressuring Big Tech companies “to update policies to keep up with new forms of climate crisis denial along with removing financial incentives, and reducing its reach and visibility.”
The goal of the CCDH is to prevent people from being able to challenge the Left’s narrative on climate change. You know, because challenging The Science™ should never be tolerated.","joe biden ’s ongoing war fossil fuel   environmental protection agency poise introduce new tailpipe emission standard serve "" de facto electric vehicle mandate "" allegation make american fuel & petrochemical manufacturer recently launch ad campaign number lead fossil fuel - produce state

They’re doing their best to prevent TV ads from exposing Biden’s EV rules.
The Wall Street Journal reported that the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) launched ads in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona, Ohio, and Montana to educate Americans about the Administration’s back-door EV mandate. Mr. Biden is “rushing to ban new gas-powered cars” and wants “to force you into an electric vehicle,” one ad says.
The Biden team protested, lying, claiming, “There is no EV mandate.”
NOW THEY’RE BLOCKING ADS
The WSJ:
Biden and his handlers don’t want voters to know that banning gas-powered cars is the end game. That’s why the progressive umbrella group Climate Power shot off a missive on Tuesday to broadcasters demanding that they pull the AFPM ads or else. These “advertisements include obvious lies aimed at deceiving the public and must be pulled from the air immediately,” Climate Power chief operating officer Jill Shesol wrote.
EPA’s proposed emissions rules are so stringent that automakers can only comply by producing an increasing number of “zero-emission vehicles” or by buying regulatory credits from EV manufacturers like Tesla.
Americans can only buy an EV or pay a fortune for the few available gas-powered cars.
The saddest part of this is the only ones who benefit are the Chinese Communists.
THE TACTIC NOW IS TO SLOW THE MANDATES UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION
The Washington Post reports that the Environmental Protection Agency is considering relaxing one of its most significant climate change rules — tailpipe emissions limits for cars and trucks — by giving automakers more time to boost sales of electric vehicles, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The administration might slow it down nine months before an election and claim it’s because of pressure.
In April, the EPA issued a proposed rule that required 67% of all new passenger car and light-duty truck sales to be EVs by 2032. Weeks later, UAW President Shawn Fain wrote that the union was withholding its endorsement of Biden’s reelection campaign over “concerns with the electric vehicle transition,” WaPo reports.
EVs will put the autoworkers out of business. Fain has said that half his workers won’t vote for Joe Biden.
The mandates are impossible to meet.
According to the New York Times:
In a concession to automakers and labor unions, the Biden administration intends to relax elements of one of its most ambitious strategies to combat climate change, limits on tailpipe emissions that are designed to get Americans to switch from gas-powered cars to electric vehicles, according to three people familiar with the plan. [Emphasis added]
Instead of essentially requiring automakers to rapidly ramp up sales of electric vehicles over the next few years, the administration would give car manufacturers more time, with a sharp increase in sales not required until after 2030, these people said. They asked to remain anonymous because the regulation has not been finalized. The administration plans to publish the final rule by early spring. [Emphasis added]
They’re tricking Americans. They won’t cancel the mandates. This is another tactic to win the election. The mandate isn’t going anywhere. If Biden wins again, he’ll be much worse.","ev carmaker lie efficiency vehicle administration pay   ’re good prevent tv ad expose biden ’s ev rule

The ad campaign launched Wednesday by American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) urges voters in seven Senate battleground states to urge lawmakers to repeal the de facto electric vehicle mandate.
Those states are Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, Ohio and Montana. It is AFPM’s second campaign targeting vulnerable Senate Democrats.
The ads also target voters in Georgia and Maine, both key states for President Biden’s reelection. Maine splits its Electoral College votes by winners of each congressional district and Georiga is a swing state.
“You’re in the driver’s seat. You choose what road to take,” one of the ads says. “But soon, you’ll be taking a back seat to big government because EPA regulators just banned most new gas-powered cars. They’ve made it clear it’s their way or the highway, even if electric vehicles aren’t right for you or your family.”
The blitz puts a spotlight on an upcoming vote forced by Senate Republicans for a rollback of the Environmental Protection Agency’s rule requiring up to two-thirds of new vehicles sold by 2032 to be some form of electric.
AFPM and other industry groups, including the American Petroleum Institute, also have threatened legal challenges.
The EPA regulation, which seeks to combat climate change by reducing emissions, put swing-state Democrats in the hot seat.
Several vulnerable Senate Democrats recently told The Washington Times they were against the EPA rule or did not want to discuss it.
Sen. Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat who is not seeking reelection, will aid GOP efforts to overturn the rule. He helped author the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, which included up to $7,500 in tax credits for EV buyers.
“First of all, we bribed them by giving a $7,500 rebate, and then on top of that, [the administration] mandates it,” Mr. Manchin told The Times. “That’s bull——. Pure bull—-.”
Republican challengers to Democratic senators have used the EPA regulations as a rallying cry.
The nonpartisan election forecaster Cook Political Report on Wednesday moved the Nevada Senate race in the GOP’s favor, shifting the contest between Sen. Jacky Rosen and Republican Sam Brown from “lean Democrat” to “toss-up.” The ratings analysis concluded Ms. Rosen “lacks an established brand to outrun Biden’s lagging numbers.”
“Nevada is now a toss-up because Jacky Rosen is a rubber stamp for Joe Biden and has made things worse for Nevadans, from high prices to the open border,” Mr. Brown said.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the trade association representing major auto manufacturers, called the EPA’s target dates a “stretch goal.”
Light-duty EV sales clocked in at 9.5% for 2023, up from 7% in 2022, 4.4% in 2021 and 2.3% in 2020. Those sales included all-electric battery vehicles and plug-in hybrids, according to data from the Alliance.
At the current rate of roughly 2.5% year-over-year growth, it would take more than 23 years without government mandates for the U.S. to reach the two-thirds EV threshold. The EPA wants the market to achieve it in eight years.","senate democrats battleground state target new seven - figure ad campaign hit president biden ’s plan phase gas - power car
