2457,"Indonesia's government used the Jakarta auto show to double down on plans to drive production and sales of electric vehicles in Southeast Asia's largest auto market, but buyers are not sold yet.
The price premium on electric vehicles (EVs), questions about the availability of charging stations and doubts about new brands are reasons to hold back for now, said visitors to the auto show in Tangerang, on the outskirts of Jakarta.
Dody Hartono, a visitor at the auto show who plans to buy his first EV by 2024, said he wants a better deal.
""We have to make people interested first with EVs, starting with prices that should be 60% cheaper,"" the 54-year old said.
Indonesia has ambitious EV growth plans as it races Thailand and India to build out an EV industry as an alternative to China, the world's largest producer. However, EVs currently account for less than 1% of cars on its roads.
INDONESIAN ACTIVISTS BEGIN HUNGER STRIKE TO PROTEST DELAY IN BILL THAT PROTECTS DOMESTIC WORKERS
The government has slashed the value-added tax on EVs to 1% from 11%, bringing the starting price of the cheapest Hyundai Ioniq 5 to under $45,000 from over $51,000 in Indonesia.
Hartono said a price between $10,000 and $13,000 would be more appealing.
There are only two EVs on offer near that range, Wuling's Air EV Lite and Seres Group's E1 at around $12,300. The cheapest gasoline-powered car in Indonesia, the Daihatsu Ayla, starts under $9,000.
China's Seres Group is the EV manufacturing partner of technology company Huawei.
By comparison, one of the best-selling EVs in China, the BYD Seagull, starts at just over $10,000, but other companies - and even China's own automakers - struggle to match that kind of pricing in export markets.
BYD's ATTO 3, the best-selling EV in Southeast Asia in the first quarter, starts in Thailand at just over $31,000.
Hendra Pratama, 42, a customer shopping for an EV at the auto show said the price premium in Indonesia needed to be reduced to attract lower-middle income consumers.
""It's not affordable,"" he said.
Confidence Issues
Toyota, its affiliate Daihatsu, and Honda account for two-thirds of auto sales in Indonesia but have been slow to pivot to EVs.
TIKTOK WON'T LAUNCH CROSS-BORDER E-COMMERCE SERVICES IN INDONESIA AMID CONCERNS
Hendra Budi, 44, said price was not an issue for him but he wanted to have more confidence in the brands on offer.
""If Toyota or Honda launched a full EV, we will be interested,"" he said.
Toyota has said it has no plans yet to build an EV in Indonesia.
Indonesia's industry ministry announced at the auto show, which concluded on Sunday, that it would offer automakers two more years to qualify for production incentives.
The announcement was followed by investment commitments from China's Neta EV brand and Japan's Mitsubishi Motors.

Indonesia has set a target of producing some 600,000 EVs by 2030. That would be more than 100 times the number sold in Indonesia in the first half of 2023.
Indonesia's chief economic minister said he hoped the Jakarta auto show would drive sales of more than 26,000 vehicles, the number sold at the auto show last year.
The final number of cars sold – and the share of EVs in that – was not available as of Monday."
74258,"The U.S. has doubled the pace of cutting carbon emissions since President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in 2022, analysts and scientists said, with more than 80 solar, wind and energy storage projects taking advantage of the law's mix of direct payments and tax credits.
The IRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law last year provided $239 billion for clean energy, electric vehicles (EVs), electrification of buildings, and carbon management in the U.S., up 38% from 2022, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project of the policy researcher Rhodium Group and MIT. Still, experts said there is a long way to go before the law can achieve Biden's wider climate ambitions of net-zero by 2050.
Ultimately, analysts expect U.S. government direct spending and tax credits under the law will far exceed the initial $400 billion estimate. Goldman Sachs Group has projected up to $1.2 trillion spending through 2031.
MULTIPLE OBSTACLES IMPEDE THE UN'S GOAL TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE ENERGY BY 2030
Two years after passage of the landmark climate law, early winners have been sectors such as electrical power, battery manufacturing and traditional clean energies like wind and solar. The law encouraged Asian and European companies to invest more in the U.S., which in turn prompted Europe to develop its own Green Industrial Plan over worries the U.S. would pull away clean-energy projects and talent.
Still, state and local regulations have hindered development of new transmission lines, and new EV charging stations have not sprouted up as quickly as some had hoped. Also, the IRA has been much slower to encourage other types of projects, especially hydrogen, carbon sequestration, geothermal and nuclear energy, noted Jigar Shah, head of the loan programs office at the Department of Energy.
Those sectors ""continue to struggle around figuring out how exactly to put all the pieces together,"" Shah said last month at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston.
Oil companies have bristled at the criteria for tax credits for hydrogen fuel plants. Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Darren Woods warned in an interview that he might scrap a multibillion-dollar plan to build the world's largest hydrogen plant in Texas.
""The challenge has been translating the legislation of the IRA into regulation,"" Woods said, noting the proposed regulation favors hydrogen fuel from plants powered by renewable energy rather than natural gas.
Even in sectors like electric vehicles, companies are discovering ""a host of practical barriers to putting the IRA tax breaks to work"", said Jason Bordoff, founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.
For instance, he cited a lack of transmission lines that would connect new clean energy projects to the grid and local-content requirements for EVs.
Tax breaks for EV purchases under the law have U.S. automakers worried about cheap Chinese vehicles flooding the market, triggering rules for U.S. content and calls in Washington for steeper tariffs. China has protested U.S. content rules on EVs to the World Trade Organization.
BIDEN'S EPA FINALIZES STRICT TRUCK EMISSION RULES
Concern about Asian companies cornering the market on advanced technology needed for EVs and other green energy items also prompted Washington to launch aggressive investments in semiconductor plants.
""Some parts of clean energy like electric vehicles have become particularly politicized. There could be a risk that the implementation of the IRA by the administration could be slowed down,"" Bordoff said.
So far, a $7.5 billion U.S.-funded network of electric vehicle charging stations has led to only a handful of stations despite a temporary waiver of U.S. content rules.
Regulatory hurdles have hindered advancement of complex projects favored by oil companies such as hydrogen plants or carbon capture systems for oil wells, noted Roman Kramarchuk, head of climate markets and policy analytics for S&P Global Commodity Insights.
He predicted these projects would see a second wave of development ""when there is more certainty around how that financing is supposed to happen or what it takes to get a deal done.""
Oil executives at the conference in Houston also complained that regulations were making it difficult to build new natural gas pipelines, which undercut efforts to remove the gas from drilling sites.

Now, a proposed IRA-linked fee for excess methane emissions on federal lands has raised a new hurdle, ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance said, adding that ""industry is pushing back"" on that issue.
Despite the various industry complaints, the climate law has helped the U.S. reduce carbon emissions by 4% annually, double the pace of 2% a year before the law, nine research teams across the U.S. said last year in an article published in the journal Science. Still, some experts said the pace must accelerate.
""The IRA doubles the pace of reductions but should have tripled it to hit our 2030 climate goals and get on the path to net-zero by 2050,"" said Princeton Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering professor Jesse Jenkins, one of the study participants."
84584,"The U.S. Treasury Department has introduced new guidelines allowing a $7,500 electric vehicle (EV) tax credit to be used as a point-of-sale rebate, effective January 2024.
To qualify for the tax credit, consumers will need to meet income limits, with adjusted gross income limits of $300,000 for married couples and $150,000 for individuals.
Under the new rules, consumers can transfer the credit to a car dealer, reducing the vehicle's purchase price.
The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday issued new guidance on how a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit can be used as a point-of-sale rebate starting in January.
Currently, consumers can only take advantage of the $7,500 new EV credit or $4,000 used EV credit when they file their tax returns the following year.
Starting Jan. 1, consumers can transfer the credits to a car dealer, effectively lowering the vehicle’s purchase price, a change that may help boost EV sales.
Under the guidance issued Friday, consumers will need to attest they meet income limits to qualify for the tax credit or they will need to repay the government when filing their taxes.
For new vehicles, the adjusted gross income limit is $300,000 for married couples and $150,000 for individuals.
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ACCUSED OF HYPOCRISY FOR PROPOSING BORDER WALL AMID MIGRANT CRISIS
Congress approved a sweeping reform of the EV tax credits in August 2022 as part of the $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Treasury is also releasing more details on registration requirements and the mechanics of the transfer for car dealers.
Dealers will need to register via a new IRS website to offer the credits. Beginning in January, dealers can submit vehicle sales to the IRS and receive payment for tax credits within 72 hours.
Under proposed rules released Friday, credit transfers and advance payments would typically not affect dealers’ tax liability and dealer payments would not be part of a consumer's gross income.
The 2022 IRA law required vehicles to be assembled in North America to qualify for any tax credits, eliminating nearly 70% of eligible models at the time. On Jan. 1, new price caps on qualifying EVs and the limits on buyers income took effect.

In April, Treasury implemented new rules setting sourcing battery components and critical minerals to qualify.
The Biden administration must still issue rules later this year detailing what constitutes a ""Foreign Entity of Concern"" that will later disqualify EVs for credits if they have any battery components or if batteries contain critical minerals from a foreign entity of concern.
The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed rules it forecasts will result in 67% of new vehicles being EVs by 2032."
42772,"President Biden's push for Americans to stop using fossil fuels and fuel-powered cars is empowering China and hurting U.S. national security, according to a new report.
The Institute for Energy Research (IER) released a paper outlining how the ongoing effort by the Biden administration to get Americans to use renewable energy and buy electric vehicles is making the U.S. more dependent on China, thereby endangering America's national security.
""Due in large part to government intervention, the United States is becoming progressively more reliant on electric vehicles (EVs) and nonnuclear renewable energy sources for its transportation and energy needs,"" writes Thomas Wackman, a fellow at IER. ""These technologies rely on a large input of rare earth metals and other mined elements, particularly lithium and cobalt, the supply of which is dominated almost entirely by the People's Republic of China.""
The Biden administration's ""ongoing war"" against domestic U.S. oil and gas production, the report continues, puts America's energy security, and its national security, in real jeopardy.""
BIDEN DOUBLES DOWN ON GREEN ENERGY AS OPEC CUTS PRODUCTION, PRICES SOAR
President Biden controversially vowed to ""end"" and ""get rid of"" fossil fuels while campaigning for president. Since entering the White House, he has said his goal is to create a ""carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions economy by no later than 2050.""
Biden has also committed by 2030 to cut U.S. fossil fuel emissions by 52% in favor of renewable energy such as wind and solar power and for half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric.
In 2021, renewables comprised about 12% of America's primary energy consumption, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), and many politicians appear intent on getting that number much higher.
""However, renewables need far higher mineral inputs than their hydrocarbon counterparts,"" the IER report states. ""An electric vehicle, for example, requires six times the mineral resources than does a similar gasoline-powered car. While some of this demand can be filled by familiar metals like nickel, copper, and aluminum, less common minerals like lithium and cobalt play a key role, as do many so-called ‘rare earth"" elements.’""
WHITE HOUSE WANTS TO BOOST GREEN ENERGY IN COMMUNITIES REELING FROM COAL PLANT SHUTDOWNS
According to the EIA, the process of trying to eliminate carbon will cause the demand for these materials to skyrocket.
""Therein lies the danger: the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) controls almost the entire global supply chain for all these minerals and other strategic metals,"" the paper warns. ""In fact, the United States is far more dependent on Chinese imports for an increasingly important part of its energy portfolio than it ever was on the Middle East for oil supplies.""
China is a major producer of many of the dozens of minerals identified by the U.S. Department of the Interior as critical to national security and either owns or indirectly controls most of the world's mines that produce them. For example, China has been involved in projects in Sub-Saharan Africa in search of cobalt and lithium deposits to maintain its influence over the mineral supply chain.
In contrast, ""what rare earth and strategic metal extraction capacity the United States does possess is limited,"" according to the Institute for Energy Research. ""Political interests have restricted mineral exploration within the United States, leaving potentially vast reserves of strategic metals and rare earths untouched. As of this writing, only one mine in the entire country, California's Mountain Pass mine, can produce rare earth elements.""
JOE MANCHIN BLASTS BIDEN ADMIN FOR CEDING CONTROL TO CCP ON GREEN ENERGY: 'PATHETIC'
U.S. leaders in both Congress and the executive branch have increasingly spoken of China as America's chief rival across a range of domains, from industrial power to military might, arguing for a tougher approach toward Beijing.
""The more that the United States transitions its energy portfolio over to renewables at the expense of other sources — something for which the Biden administration and its environmentalist allies are outwardly committed to doing — the more dependent it becomes on its primary adversary for its energy supply,"" the report argues. ""To make matters worse, alternative energy is far from the only technology that relies on critical minerals to function. Almost every aspect of the digital economy, from smartphones to computers to internet cables, can only be manufactured with metals largely imported from China. So do a vast array of military weapons systems, including guided missiles, radar arrays, and even night vision goggles.""
As a result, according to the IER, if China were to cut off or even just restrict the flow of rare earths and strategic metals, U.S. military power would be crippled.
""More than that,"" the report states, ""economic activity could grind to a halt, as it becomes near impossible to repair old or produce new digital products. Regions that are key to the American economy, like Silicon Valley and Florida's Space Coast, would virtually cease to function. Energy shortages, too, could become common, especially in those states which have transitioned a substantial part of their energy portfolio over to renewable sources and their automobile fleet to EVs.""
GREEN GROUP INFLUENCING BIDEN ADMIN HAS DEEP TIES TO CHINESE GOVERNMENT
However, renewables now comprise a relatively small portion of U.S. energy production, and nuclear reactors are also running, seemingly lessening such a risk — for the time being.
When reached for comment, the Energy Department didn't address the IER report, instead touting its work to promote EVs and what it described as clean energy.
""Thanks to President Biden's Investing in America agenda, the U.S. has become the world's most attractive investment landscape for new energy and decarbonization technologies,"" an Energy Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""Since President Biden took office, there's been more than $90 billion of announced investments in an American-made EV batteries, helping onshore jobs for American workers and strengthen the nation's manufacturing sector. DOE will continue to move expeditiously to usher in a managed and equitable clean energy transition.""
The spokesperson never mentioned China but acknowledged ""challenges"" must be addressed regarding critical materials, saying ""responsible"" domestic efforts to produce such materials will strengthen America's economic competitiveness, energy independence, and national security.
The IER report calls on the Biden administration to stop ""targeting the [oil and gas] industry with burdensome regulations and rhetorical assaults"" so domestic producers don't scale-down their operations, thereby driving up prices and possibly causing the U.S. to seek more foreign energy. But it also says the U.S will inevitably include a growing share of EVs and renewable energy, meaning other action is required.
""It should therefore be considered a national security imperative for the United States to wean itself off Chinese strategic metals and rare earths and to develop its own extraction and refining capacity,"" the paper concludes. ""The government must support new mines, new processors and new refiners, while removing the roadblocks to industrial development and capital investment that created this situation in the first place.""
CCP-BACKED TECH COMPANIES ARE POISED TO CASH IN ON BIDEN'S CLIMATE BILL, NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS WARN
Such processing facilities can be expensive and must navigate environmental restrictions placed on mineral extraction in the U.S. and allied Western countries that China doesn't have.
The U.S. is endowed with the critical minerals needed for EVs, wind turbines, solar panels, and even military equipment, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. However, according to a separate IER report published this week, the Biden administration ""is revoking leases, delaying permits, and listing plants as endangered species to hinder critical mineral mine development to please its environmental friends, who do not want mining to occur in the United States while calling for the use of technologies requiring multiples of additional minerals consumption.""
In order to address the critical minerals issue, the administration is currently pursuing trade agreements focused on such minerals with allies in Europe, Japan, and elsewhere, both to allow them to qualify for EV tax benefits and to begin shifting energy supply chains away from China.

31383,"Wastewater samples have shown elevated levels of a respiratory virus that has been linked to paralysis in some children, sparking concerns about potentially rising cases in the U.S., according to a report from WastewaterSCAN.
The virus, enterovirus D68, is one of ""100 non-polio enteroviruses,"" according to Cleveland Clinic’s website.
While the virus itself is common, neurological complications are ""relatively rare,"" the clinic noted.
LATEST COVID VARIANT, XEC, HAS SPREAD TO HALF OF US STATES, REPORTS SAY
""It circulates in the summer, like all its other enteroviral cousins, but this one causes a specific problem,"" Dr. Sharon Nachman, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at Stony Brook Children’s Hospital in New York, told Fox News Digital.
""It affects the nerves and can cause paralysis across the spinal cord.""
The virus typically has ""on and off years,"" Nachman said, noting that this looks to be an ""on year"" based on recent wastewater data.
What to know about wastewater data
WastewaterSCAN, a Stanford University-based nonprofit in partnership with Emory University, monitors nationwide samples of wastewater sewage for infectious diseases to help alert public health officials, according to its website.
The organization also contributes its data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC)’s National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS).
RACCOON ROUNDWORM INFECTIONS REPORTED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, HEALTH OFFICIALS WARN
Wastewater samples can point to early warning signs of infectious diseases in a community, even before symptoms are detected, the CDC noted.
""Wastewater is a good surrogate marker for whether a virus is circulating in the environment,"" Nachman told Fox News Digital.
""So the take-home message is that this virus is circulating.""
As of Sept. 21, WastewaterSCAN’s data showed that levels of enterovirus D68 in sewage were classified as ""moderate,"" with 306 out of 400 samples testing positive within the last 10 days.
Symptoms and complications
In most people, the infection causes only mild cold-like symptoms, such as runny or stuffy nose, cough, fever, body aches and sore throat, according to infectious disease experts.
In rare cases, it has been linked to severe respiratory symptoms and a nervous system disorder called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM).
SUPERBUGS DUE TO ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE COULD KILL 39 MILLION PEOPLE BY 2050, LARGE STUDY FINDS
AFM can occur when the EV-D68 virus affects the nervous system, causing muscle weakness in the arms and legs, difficulty swallowing, drooping eyelids and even paralysis, according to the CDC.
Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau in Oceanside, New York, described AFM as ""a rare but potentially very serious illness that can mimic polio and can cripple children.""
""Wastewater is a good surrogate marker for whether a virus is circulating in the environment.""
In most cases, the paralysis is temporary and can be treated with physical therapy to address the weakness.
""There are very few cases of permanent paralysis,"" Nachman told Fox News Digital.
Individuals most at risk for developing symptoms related to EV-D68 include infants, children and teenagers, the CDC noted.
Children with asthma also have a higher risk of severe illness.
In the U.S., EV-D68 tends to peak during the summer and fall months, the CDC noted.
Prevention and treatment
The virus typically spreads from person to person through coughing, sneezing and touching contaminated surfaces, according to experts.
Children should avoid sharing drinks, cups and utensils to help prevent potential spread, Nachman advised.

Other prevention methods include disinfecting commonly touched surfaces, following proper hand-washing hygiene and keeping kids home when they are sick, Cleveland Clinic stated.
If a child complains that they are feeling weakness in their legs or having trouble walking, that could be a warning sign of EV-D68, Nachman said.
Parents should contact a pediatrician if they notice these symptoms.
""Your child's pediatrician is an expert on your child, and that's a better choice than just an urgent care walk-in center who doesn't know them,"" Nachman said.

Those experiencing severe symptoms, including difficulty breathing, confusion, slurred speech, weakness or paralysis, should seek emergency medical treatment.
A blood test, lumbar puncture (spinal tap) or MRI may be required to confirm the diagnosis after ruling out the flu and COVID, per Cleveland Clinic.
No vaccine is currently available for enterovirus D68, and there is no specific antiviral medication to treat it.
Treatment typically includes supportive care for symptoms and physical therapy if weakness occurs, according to Nachman.

There are a slew of reasons why Americans have been rather hesitant to trade in their gas-powered cars for electric one. One of those reasons is a fear of the car running out of battery with no charging station in sight, or simply the hassle of waiting for the car to charge.

Detroit has offered a solution for drivers with a new system that allows electric cars to drive and charge simultaneously. Detroit is the first city in the nation to test out this new technology.
At this point in the development process, the technology is being tested along a quarter-mile stretch in downtown Detroit.
The tech is produced by Electreon, and is made up of copper charging coils located under the street. These coils are activated and transfer electricity only when an electric vehicle containing a receiver is near.

""Automatically, it knows who you are and charges you while you drive or while you stand still wirelessly without a plug, without anything. And it's seamless with your driving behavior,"" said Stefan Tongur, Ph.D., vice president of business development at Electreon, per CBS Detroit.
This system allows electric cars to develop a charge when driving on the road or when the car is stopped on the street. The technology is still in its beginning stages, but Michigan's Department of Transportation and Electron have made a five-year commitment to develop the technology.

""In Michigan, we want to stay ahead of the curve. We want to lead the curve,"" Michigan DOT Director Bradley C. Wieferich said, per The Associated Press.
This new technology comes on the heels of a push by the Biden administration to create half a million electric vehicle charging stations across the United States, aligning with a proposal made in April to have two-thirds of vehicles electric by 2032.
Car dealers have pushed back on this proposal, with 3,882 dealers writing a public letter in response. The letter states that even though there is a wide range of electric vehicles available to consumers, the demand simply isn't keeping up with supply, which is over populating their lots with EV's.

""Mr. President, it is time to tap the brakes on the unrealistic government electric vehicle mandate. Allow time for the battery technology to advance. Allow time to make BEVs more affordable,"" the letter to the president states. ""Allow time to develop domestic sources for the minerals to make batteries. Allow time for the charging infrastructure to be built and prove reliable. And most of all, allow time for the American consumer to get comfortable with the technology and make the choice to buy an electric vehicle."""
2449,"A local news outlet that helped expose a wide-reaching public corruption scandal has filed its first defense against a defamation lawsuit brought by former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, with the news outlet arguing it engaged in constitutionally protected speech.
In Mississippi Today's first legal response since Bryant sued the outlet and its CEO in the Circuit Court of Madison County on July 26 for allegedly defaming him in public comments on the misspending of $77 million of federal welfare funds, attorney Henry Laird outlined on Friday 19 legal defenses against the former governor's claims.
The attorney also requested that the ex-governor's complaint be dismissed.
""We will vigorously defend this case and ensure the people of Mississippi that the press will not be intimidated,"" said Mississippi Today CEO Mary Margaret White in a statement. ""We stand for press freedom and will always uphold our mission of building a more informed Mississippi.""
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WITHDRAWS FROM MISSISSIPPI SECRETARY OF STATE RACE DUE TO HEALTH ISSUES
In addition to free speech protections, Mississippi Today's legal defense is built around New York Times Co. v. Sullivan., a 1964 decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court greatly limited the ability of public officials to sue for defamation. It ruled that news outlets are protected against a libel judgment unless it can be proven that they published with ""actual malice"" — knowing that something was false or acting with a ""reckless disregard"" to whether or not it was true.
Bryant's July 26 lawsuit came just over two months after Mississippi Today and one of its reporters, Anna Wolfe, won a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage of the misspending of welfare funds intended for poor Mississippians that were instead diverted to the rich and powerful.
Prosecutors have said the state’s human services department gave money to nonprofit organizations that spent it on projects such as a $5 million volleyball facility at the University of Southern Mississippi — a project for which retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre agreed to raise money.
MULLEN AUTOMOTIVE'S NEW ELECTRIC CAR FACTORY IN MISSISSIPPI MARKS MILESTONE WITH DEBUT OF CLASS 3 EV TRUCK
Mississippi Auditor Shad White announced in February 2020 that criminal charges were brought against six people, including John Davis, a former Mississippi Department of Human Services executive director who had been chosen by Bryant. The announcement came weeks after Bryant, a Republican, finished his second and final term as governor. Davis and others have pleaded guilty.
Wolfe’s ""The Backchannel"" series shed light on the embezzlement scheme, winning a Pulitzer in May. An article published on Mississippi Today’s website announcing the honor said the outlet revealed how Bryant ""used his office to steer the spending of millions of federal welfare dollars"" to ""benefit his family and friends.""
That announcement — and an earlier report Mississippi Today published on the impact of its coverage — are the two primary written communications Bryant says are defamatory. Also at the center of his lawsuit are comments White made at a journalism conference that, according to Bryant's attorney William Quin II, misrepresented Bryant’s connection to the squandered welfare dollars.
In a May 11 letter, Bryant said White made a ""false and defamatory"" statement about him when, at a journalism conference in February, she said Mississippi Today broke the story that Bryant ""embezzled"" welfare money. No criminal charges have been filed against Bryant, and he has said he told the auditor in 2019 about possible misspending of money from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families antipoverty program.
Reached by phone Monday, Quin said Mississippi Today's response ""speaks for itself"" and declined to comment further.
In an amended complaint filed on Aug. 24, Quin listed nine unnamed clients from whom he claims Bryant lost almost $500,000 in business due to White's comments at the Knight Media Forum in February. Bryant joined a private consulting firm shortly after leaving public office.

Mississippi Today published an apology from White in May, a week after Bryant threatened a lawsuit, but his attorneys have said the apology wasn't specific enough.
Favre also has not been charged with a crime, but the Mississippi Department of Human Services, with a new director, filed a civil lawsuit last year against him, along with more than three dozen other people and businesses, to try to recover more than $20 million of the misspent welfare money.
Among the defendants in that civil suit is Nancy New, an ex-nonprofit head who pleaded guilty in April 2022 to state charges of misusing welfare money.
On Friday, the same day Mississippi Today filed its response to Bryant's lawsuit, New's attorneys, Gerald and Carroll Bufkin, filed a motion to quash a subpoena by the former governor. Bryant’s subpoena purports to seek documents relevant to his defamation suit, the Bufkins said."
9902,"A judge in Virginia dismissed a lawsuit Tuesday that had sought to declare two books as obscene for children and to restrict their distribution to minors, including by booksellers and libraries.
The books in question were ""Gender Queer: A Memoir"" by Maia Kobabe and ""A Court of Mist and Fury"" by Sarah J. Maas.
Both books describe or illustrate sexual acts that prompted the lawsuit. In a petition to the court, Tommy Altman, a Virginia Beach tattoo shop owner and former Republican congressional candidate, said the depictions were inappropriate for children.
VIRGINIA POLICE: 'EXTRAORDINARY' GOOD SAMARITAN CAPTURED SUSPECT AFTER DEADLY SHOOTING
Altman asked the court to issue an order under state law against distributing, selling or loaning the books to minors. The suit was filed in April and dismissed Tuesday before it could proceed to trial.
Circuit Court Judge Pamela S. Baskervill struck it down on jurisdictional grounds, citing state law as well as the U.S. Constitution.
For example, Baskervill wrote that Virginia law doesn't give her the specific authority to determine whether the books are obscene for minors.
The judge also wrote that restricting the books' distribution would authorize ""prior restraint"" of speech and violate the First Amendment. The judge also described concerns about prosecuting someone who didn't know they were selling or loaning books that were deemed to be obscene.
HAZING CHARGES AGAINST FORMER VCU FRATERNITY MEMBERS DROPPED IN CONNECTION WITH FRESHMAN’S DEATH
The judge's order comes at a time when book challenges and bans have surged across the U.S. to levels not seen in decades. Virginia has been on the frontlines, with public school curricula and books serving as a major prong for Republican Glenn Youngkin’s successful run for governor last year.
Author and publisher groups hailed the judge's decision.
Maria A. Pallante, president and CEO of the Association of American Publishers, said Tuesday that it was an ""unequivocal victory for the free speech rights of readers, authors, publishers, booksellers and libraries.""
Eden Heilman, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, said ""access to diverse perspectives is a huge part of our democracy, and any efforts to thwart that are really concerning.""
VIRGINIA HOUSE FIRE KILLS 2 PEOPLE
Heilman, who represented independent booksellers and other parties in the suit, said her organization will continue to fight such legal efforts.
Many of the targeted books have focused on sexuality, gender identity or race. Kobabe's ""Gender Queer,"" a graphic novel that contains explicit illustrations of oral sex and masturbation, has served as a particular flashpoint.
The Virginia Beach school board removed the book from school libraries earlier this year, The Virginian-Pilot reported. Schools in Fairfax County, in northern Virginia, also briefly removed it last year before it was reinstated. Loudoun County Public Schools chose to pull the book.
In his petition against the fantasy book ""Court of Mist and Fury,"" Altman said it ""contains pages of extreme sexual conduct not suitable for children as young as 10 years old.""
WINSOME SEARS DOUBLES DOWN ON YOUNGKIN'S VOW TO BATTLE LEFT'S EV PUSH: 'WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF THIS THING'
In his petition against ""Gender Queer,"" Altman cited content that illustrates ""two minors engaged in sexual intercourse,"" among other actions.
Jeff Trexler, an attorney for the author of ""Gender Queer,"" pointed out that Altman was running for Congress when he filed the suit. Altman lost in a crowded Republican primary.
""This isn't 200 pages of people from various gender identities, having sex and nothing else,"" Trexler said. ""It's an award-winning work as a literary memoir and as a graphic novel. It’s been relevant to lots of people in terms of understanding themselves and their children""
Tim Anderson, Altman's attorney, said the lawsuit ""was never never about trying to ban gay literature or trans literature.""
POLICE SEARCH FOR SUSPECT AFTER REPORT OF MAN WITHOUT PANTS ATTACKING WOMAN ON VIRGINIA TRAIL
""This was simply just saying these (books) have really sexual explicit content and it’s not appropriate for kids,"" Anderson said.
Anderson said the suit's intent was changing a state law that determines what is obscene for both children and adults alike. Altman wanted a ""carve out"" that deems what's obscene for juveniles specifically.
Anderson, who is also a state lawmaker, said Altman is considering his options following the judge's order. He said one way forward could be a ratings system for books like there are for video games and movies.
""Fundamentally, what we’re trying to do is get to a point where parents are more in the driver’s seat of what their children are consuming,"" Anderson said."
49939,"Elon Musk told attendees that the Cyber Rodeo he held at Tesla's new Austin, Tex., factory wouldn't have a strict door policy, and that might also apply to the Tesla Cybertruck.
Musk brought the latest prototype for the much-delayed electric pickup onto the stage to show off a few of its new features. That is to say, a few features it no longer has.
Tesla has taken the handles off all the stainless steel vehicle's doors, which will now have the ability to open automatically.
""Who needs handles? The car can tell that you're there, and it just knows that it needs to open,"" Musk said without further explanation or a demonstration.
The Tesla Model X can be set to open the driver's door as someone approaches with the key fob, but it's not clear how passenger doors will be handled on the Cybertruck.
Along with the new entry system, the vehicle is now equipped with additional lighting that's closer to production spec, more conventional wheels and a single large windshield wiper blade.
Musk also recently said that the first models will have four electric motors and four-wheel steering like the GMC Hummer EV, as well as its competitor's ability to drive sideways like a crab.

49946,"Journalists, pundits and liberal celebrities alike have offered an onslaught of energy takes as the Russia-Ukraine crisis unfolds and surging gas prices cause pain at the pump for average Americans.
Americans are experiencing the highest gas prices since the 2007-09 financial crisis, with the national gas price average reaching more than $4 per gallon – the highest average to date, according to AAA.
To combat the shocking price increase, many have echoed White House talking points lecturing Americans to buy more electric cars. Other liberal pundits have insisted Americans should simply eliminate oil dependence altogether without offering a viable alternative.
RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES
As a result, NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck said ""few stories will do a better job of exposing the almost impenetrable bubble of the far-left and their celebrity pals"" than coverage of gas prices and energy costs that is currently dominating the news cycle.
""It's not just tone deaf, but demeaning and insulting for them to almost celebrate the lack of adequate oil supply and sky-high prices at the pump,"" Houck told Fox News Digital. ""Contrary to their worldview, working men and women aren't able to have the funds to foot the bill for a Telsa or electric car or accountant to find them the massive tax breaks. No matter what they say, viewers will see right through these smug pleas to 'go green.'""
TOM COTTON: JOE BIDEN’S POLICY ON OIL AND GAS IS ‘ALMOST A FARCE’
‘A lot of talk’
On Tuesday, MSNBC’s Katy Tur responded to President Biden banning Russian oil by pondering aloud why we simply don’t ""go green"" and ditch the need to foreign oil to truly hurt the Kremlin.
""We only use about 8%. Again, our allies would need to get involved, because so much of Europe is dependent on Russian oil,"" Tur responded. ""It’s also something that Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut brought up today was this just exposes how insane it is that we rely — we rely on energy from authoritarian leaders, and we are not self-reliant on our own energy. A lot of talk about why we don’t go green.""
WHITE HOUSE BLAMES RUSSIA FOR RECORD-HIGH GAS PRICES, COINING '#PUTINPRICEHIKE'
On the same episode of ""Katy Tur Reports,"" NPR’s Roben Farzad suggested this crisis was in part due to Americans not learning any ""lessons"" from the high gas prices of 2008, by continuing to buy large trucks instead of electric vehicles.
""Look around you, Katy. Everybody is driving a big pickup truck, SUVs, gigantic SUVs are back in vogue. We talk a big game, but this happens time and time again to the U.S. consumer,"" he griped, adding that he didn't want to come across as ""some blue checkmark lecturing people in a time of pain.""
Farzad also faulted consumers for complaining about gas prices.
""Time and time again, the United States consumer is saying, ‘Well, I'm in pain. What can we do?' And we seemingly take the easy answer out every time,"" he told Tur.
""Time and time again, the United States consumer is saying, ‘Well, I'm in pain. What can we do?' And we seemingly take the easy answer out every time.""
— Roben Farzad, NPR
The conversations on MSNBC came the day after Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Monday said the American people stand to benefit from having more electric vehicles on the road but failed to elaborate on how they could become more affordable. While touting the benefits of clean transportation, Buttigieg remarked that Americans from ""rural to suburban to urban communities can all benefit from the gas savings of driving an EV.""
Although the cost of electric vehicles has come down in recent years, they still remain out of reach for millions of Americans, with an average price hovering around $50,000.
Colbert slammed as ‘elitist’
CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert apparently got Buttigieg’s memo, but was widely slammed for remarks made Tuesday on ""The Late Show.""
""Today the average gas price in America hit an all-time record high over $4 per gallon. OK, that stings, but a clean conscience is worth a buck or two. It's important. It's important. I'm willing to pay $4 a gallon. Hell, I'll pay $15 a gallon because I drive a Tesla,"" Colbert said.
His comments were criticized as ""elitist"" coming from a comedian earning $15 million a year.
Last week, ABC News’ ""The View"" touched on the subject when co-host Sunny Hostin called for Americans to ""uptick our oil supply"" despite climate issues because of the ongoing humanitarian crisis. However, co-host Sara Haines declared we need to eliminate oil dependence altogether.
""We have to take away our dependence on oil. This is one thing that when we talk about getting clean energy in this country everyone says, ‘Oh, here go the environmentalists again,’ This is why we have to get off. It's not sustainable,"" Haines said.
""It makes us dependent on the Middle East. It makes us dependent on places like Russia,"" she continued. ""If people don’t get serious about the fact that's not an environmental issue, it’s an economic issue, it’s a national security issue.""
MSNBC GUEST: HIGH GAS PRICES WILL FORCE AMERICANS TO ACCEPT ‘THE TRUTH’ OF GREEN ENERGY
CNN: ‘OK with paying higher prices’
CNN’s Vanessa Yurkevich said on Tuesday that Americans are ""OK"" with spending more at the pump if it ""holds Russia accountable"" for invading Ukraine.
""If you look at it globally, if the European Union decides to do something similar as to what President Biden is going to be doing in his announcement,"" she said prior to Biden’s official announcement.
""Stopping all Russian imports and energy into the country. That could have a significant ripple effect on the global energy market, then pushing prices here at home at the pump a lot higher,"" Yurkevich said. ""People we’ve spoken to over the last couple weeks, they’re OK with paying higher prices if it means holding Russia accountable for what they are doing in Ukraine.""
When Biden announced the ban on Russian oil, he also defended his environmental policies and regulations that obstructed domestic oil production.
""It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production, that’s simply not true,"" Biden stated.
STEPHEN COLBERT KNOCKED FOR DOWNPLAYING GAS PRICES: ‘A CLEAN CONSCIENCE IS WORTH A BUCK OR TWO’
In live coverage afterward, ""CBS Mornings"" co-anchor Gayle King repeated the president’s claim.
""He also made it clear… that his policies, the Biden administration policies, are not hurting oil production in this country. He wanted to make that clear, too,"" King said.
CBS senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang then cited the White House's excuses, blaming oil companies instead of Biden’s policies.
""Right, because that’s what Republicans have been saying very forcefully. Wondering why we can’t just ramp up oil production here. Well, the president just said that oil companies have the option to do that right now, but they aren’t taking it. And we did talk to a commodities expert, a strategist who said that’s exactly right,"" Jiang said.
‘Wind’ from Bette Midler
Far-left actress Bette Midler tweeted, ""Since the Russian invasion, the cost to produce wind energy has gone up $0.00,"" prompting critics to explain to the privileged actress that cars cannot run on wind.
""Show me the cars and airplanes and trucks and trains that can use wind power. And apparently it does not cost anything to build the windmills and infrastructure to harness the energy,"" conservative pundit Carmine Sabia responded.
Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson feels the Green agenda is a ""danger to our national security"" itself.
""Maybe decades from now we will have the technology to replace fossil fuels, but until then it is reckless to leave ourselves vulnerable. The Green agenda also is elitist, ignoring the costs imposed on working class people from higher gasoline and heating sources,"" Jacobson told Fox News Digital.
‘Significant, of course’
Meanwhile, White House press secretary Jen Psaki continued to shield Biden from fuel-related criticism Wednesday as she was grilled on whether Americans simply need to wait until 2030 – the year that Biden has set a goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions – in order to combat gas surges.
""No, that has never been our theory or our belief, I would say that since President Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian border, the price of gas at the pump in America has gone up 75 cents, which is significant, of course,"" Psaki said during a news briefing.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
Psaki said it is widely believed that the buildup of Putin’s troops along the Ukraine border has caused many of the issues that occurred during Biden’s time in the White House.
""The reality, as you know, is that Russia is the world’s third-largest oil producer and energy supply disruptions and market volatility are the result of his aggressions,"" she continued. ""We need to ensure the supply meets the demand out there in the marketplace. There's a couple of ways to do that. Obviously, we're engaging with big global oil producers around the world to meet that demand. But there are also, as we've talked about a few times in here, 9,000 unused oil leases that oil companies could certainly tap into. And we've encouraged them to do that."""
49971,"General Motors is going back to the future, but definitely not in a DeLorean.
The GMC Hummer EV pickup reboots the infamous gas guzzling nameplate on an all-electric full-size pickup to kick off the age of Ultium.
Ultium is General Motors’ electric vehicle platform that will underpin all of its upcoming EVs, large and small. The skateboard-style chassis is very different from the one used for the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt subcompact hatchback, which never generated the kind of excitement that Teslas do.
The full-size Hummer EV was meant to remedy that problem in a big way. GMC pulled out all the stops and created what it bills as a ""supertruck"" as Ultium’s debutante. After a first drive I can report that the title is deserved.
GMC is starting at the top with the limited availability and fully-loaded $112,595 Hummer EV Edition 1, but will follow it with several trims that culminate in a $79,995 model with less content in 2024. For those looking for more affordable electric pickup, an Ultium-based Sierra EV will be in showrooms next year along with a Hummer EV SUV.
The Hummer EV Edition 1 comes with a tri-motor all-wheel-drivetrain -- one in front and two in the rear -- with a combined output of 1,000 horsepower and 1,200 pound-feet of torque. That makes it the both the most powerful pickup and General Motors vehicle ever.
It’s also equipped with a 200-kilowatt-hour battery pack that is the largest in any retail EV today and good for 329 miles of range per charge. It’s compatible with the fastest 800-volt public charging stations that can add 100 miles of electricity in 10 minutes, or fill it from 10% to 80% in 42 minutes, which is shorter than it takes to recharge batteries half that size in some vehicles. Plug it into a 240-volt outlet at home and it’ll be parked overnight.
A fully-independent suspension system with computer-controlled shocks, adjustable air springs and four-wheel-steering round out the package and pack on the pounds. The Hummer EV weighs over 9,000 pounds, qualifying it as a heavy duty truck.
That means GMC doesn’t legally have to publicize its efficiency figures, but it has. The Hummer EV gets the equivalent of 47 mpg. Not bad for a behemoth, but a far cry from the two-size smaller 835 hp Rivian R1T. Don’t expect it to do as well while either hauling the 1,300-pound payload or towing the 7,500 pounds it’s rated for.
The Hummer EV is also wide to give it better stability during high performance driving and allow the suspension to provide a limber 13-inches of wheel travel, so it’s required the wear the amber marker lights of an oversized truck in front that are also seen on the Ford F-150 Raptor and Ram 1500 TRX high performance pickups.
Removable translucent roof panels are standard, and you can take out the T-bar over the front seats and roll down the rear window to maximize the open air experience. All the panels fit in the Hummer EV’s power front trunk, so they can come along for the ride.
Top off or on, the interior is spacious, modern and functional, with dual widescreen displays for the instruments and infotainment system. The upholstery and an abundance of hard plastic don’t quite live up to the six-figure price tag, especially if you park next to a similarly-priced Cadillac Escalade at the club, but it was meant to get dirty now and then.
A lunar motif can be found throughout, which celebrates both GM’s involvement building the electric Lunar Roving Vehicle and the accelerated development program that brought the Hummer EV to market in less than two years.
The Hummer EV itself is very quick. While the nominal ride height provides 10 inches of ground clearance, the mischievously named ""Watts To Freedom"" mode drops it by three inches as the powertrain temperature is optimized to enable three-second sprints to 60 mph.
The space theme is appropriate when you try it because the experience in such a massive machine is like hitching a ride on an asteroid hurtling toward earth. Unlike some launch control systems, WTF stays engaged after a run, so you just need to stop, step on the brake, step on the gas and let go of the brake to do it again. Fun fact: It works on dirt, and is even more of a thrill there.
FILLING A GAS-POWERED VEHICLE CAN STILL BE CHEAPER THAN CHARGING AN ELECTRIC ONE
Just as impressive is the Hummer EV’s ability to stop from 60 mph in less than 140 feet, which isn’t much more than some sports sedans need. The regenerative braking action of the electric motors, 14-inch brake rotors and a unique set of 35-inch Goodyear Wrangler Territory all-terrain tires with a custom rubber compound and construction all play their parts bringing the beast to a stop.
Driven normally, the Hummer EV is as smooth as a GMC Yukon SUV. Its Herculean power makes it feel as light as a light duty truck and the four-wheel-steering system can turn the rear wheels up to 10 degrees opposite the fronts, allowing it to make tighter turns than a Chevrolet Sonic subcompact car.
HUMMER EV LEAD ENGINEER AARON PFAU REVEALS THE SUPERTRUCK'S SECRETS ON THE FOX GARAGE:
It also has GM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving system, an adaptive cruise control that uses GPS maps, sensors and facial recognition technology to let drivers remove their hands and feet from the controls as long as they’re watching the road. The latest can pass slower cars automatically if the lane to the left is clear, although it doesn’t move back on its own. Additional functionality will be added via over-the-air updates when it becomes available.
Super Cruise doesn’t do any good off-road, but the four-wheel-steering lets the monster slither down a rock-strewn wash like a well-fed rattlesnake as you keep an eye out for obstacles with its 360-degree camera system that includes views underneath the truck and washers for the cameras mounted there. Several traction modes are available for different surfaces and conditions and the Hummer has both a mechanical electronic locking front differential and the ability to mimic one with the two rear motors for the most extreme situations.
Things weren’t too crazy on the trails outside Phoenix where I had the chance to test it, but I did crawl up a few narrow climbs over large boulders threatening to scrape the armored flat bottom protecting the battery, which can be fully submerged as it wades through 32 inches of water. Had I gotten stuck, the suspension has an Extract mode that can jack the truck up six inches to get free. It’s only available at very low speeds and isn’t currently activated on production trucks, but will be enabled through a software update soon.
The Hummer EV already has a standout feature called CrabWalk mode that turns the four wheels in the same direction to drive diagonally at 10 degrees and is more natural to use that sounds. The number of practical use cases may be limited, but it’s such an attention getter that even Tesla CEO Elon Musk has taken notice.
Months after GMC revealed it, Musk said the much-delayed Tesla Cybertruck will get rear-steer so ""it can drive diagonally like a crab,"" but we’ll have to wait awhile to see one do that.
The Cybertruck was originally scheduled to enter production at the same time as the Hummer EV in 2021, but has since been delayed to 2023. Meanwhile, the Hummer EV is sold out until 2024, which means it's still a truck of the future for anyone who’s not already on the list or willing to pay $275,000 for a used one, which has already happened more than once."
49973,"The much anticipated 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV was unveiled Wednesday during GM CEO Mary Barra's CES keynote address with features designed to take on the Ford F-150 Lightning in the quickly-growing electric pickup segment.
The full-size truck will be built on the same platform as the GMC Hummer EV when it launches in 2023 in commercial WT and luxury RST First Edition trims.
Chevrolet said both models will have an estimated driving range of over 400 miles between charges and the capability to recharge at speeds of up to 100 miles worth of electricity in 10 minutes at a fast charging station.
The WT (Work Truck) will come with a 510 hp all-wheel-drive system with 615 lb-ft of torque, a payload rating of 1,200 pounds and a standard towing capacity of 8,000 pounds, while the RST’s powertrain is rated at 664 hp and 780 lb-ft and will be able to tow up to 10,000 pounds. A future fleet model will be added to the lineup with a maximum trailer capacity of 20,000 pounds, which rivals current heavy duty trucks.
Both models have crew cab body styles, 5-foot 11-inch beds, and waterproof front trunks that can be fitted with accessories including a slide-out tool box. The loaded RST adds a Multi-Flex Midgate similar to the one featured on the discontinued Chevrolet Avalanche that allows the rear wall of the cabin to be folded down into the cab to extend the load floor to over nine feet.
An optional PowerBase system uses the battery pack as a 10.2 kW power source through up to 10 outlets and has a rack integrated into the bedside wall for storing tools while they charge.
Inside, the Silverado EV has a full digital instrument cluster and large central infotainment system display along with a head-up display projected on the windshield in the RST, which offers GM’s Super Cruise hands-free highway driving system with trailer capability.
The RST also gets an air suspension system that can raise and lower the vehicle to optimize it’s on-road and off-road performance and a full panoramic glass roof.

Production of the WT is scheduled to kick off in spring of 2023 at a yet to be announced starting price and the RST First Edition will follow in the fall at $105,000. Chevrolet said a $39,900 entry level model with a smaller battery pack and shorter range will be added to the lineup later along with several additional trims, including an off-road Trail Boss, at prices ranging from $50,000 to $80,000."
49976,"One year ago this week, President Biden took office and immediately canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline, marking the beginning of an assault on domestic energy production that has increased global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) and the price of energy. Filling up your car is less affordable, the cost of home heating has increased, and electricity prices are spiking.
While we stunt our economy to reduce domestic emissions, Europe and countries around the world burn coal as an alternative to U.S. natural gas. Biden’s policies have failed, even in their primary objective.
The administration’s solitary focus on lowering domestic emissions has sacrificed U.S. interests. Reducing emissions, specifically global emissions, is crucial. However, good energy and climate policy must meet at the nexus of the environment, national security, economy, and affordable energy. Any long-term strategy must balance these four. If any are ignored, the plan will inevitably collapse.
BIDEN'S FIRST YEAR WAS A YEAR MARKED BY CRISES
At best, the administration has considered two of these factors in any given decision. After suffocating domestic oil production in the name of reducing American fingerprints on fossil fuel production, the administration was caught flat-footed when gas prices skyrocketed. Contributing to record inflation, climbing gas prices are felt by nearly every American.
President Biden’s solution has been to beg OPEC for more oil. Presumably, he prefers to beg OPEC because encouraging the U.S. oil and gas industry to develop America’s resources would provoke backlash from the far Left. However, importing oil is more expensive for consumers and increases global GHGe compared to domestic oil production.
The administration does not have its priorities straight. The longer simplistic thinking dominates American energy policy, the more our energy security will diminish.
The administration continues to receive justified, bipartisan backlash for allowing the Russians to construct the Nord Stream II Pipeline into Germany. Rather than the U.S. producing and exporting cleaner-burning American natural gas to Europe, Europeans will become dependent on Russian gas that has double the lifecycle emissions. It gives Russia control over whether the lights stay on in Europe. This misstep puts our climate and security interests, and those of our allies, at risk.
We need to go beyond talking-point policy. We need to focus on what can actually work.
The administration’s increasing focus on electric vehicles (EV) ignores that China has a near monopoly on resources needed to make EV batteries and uses coal-fired plants to build them. Rather than addressing this glaring environmental and geopolitical issue or promoting reform that could allow more domestic mining for these minerals, Democrats’ failed Build Back Better plan intended to tax the middle class to give millionaires subsidies to buy electric cars. American taxpayers should not be subsidizing $80,000 cars made with high-emitting Chinese coal.
We need to go beyond talking-point policy and consider the secondary and tertiary effects. We need to focus on what can actually work.
Increased production of U.S. natural gas lowers electric bills. It encourages developing nations to use cleaner-burning natural gas instead of coal. Investing in domestic oil and gas production creates U.S. jobs. It lowers domestic and global emissions. It also increases U.S. energy security and makes us essential to the energy security of others.

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was a great start to responsibly lowering emissions while simultaneously accounting for national security, economic impact, and affordable electricity and gasoline prices. Our next step is to build on this work by continuing to create U.S. jobs and keeping prices low for consumers.
We can responsibly address climate change; we just have to think first."
56711,"Jeep has confirmed it will have an all-electric model in its lineup by 2023, but what will it be?
The automaker currently sells the plug-in hybrid Wrangler 4xe in the U.S. along with the Compass and Renegade 4xe overseas and recently revealed a full electric vehicle will be available somewhere in two years, but nothing about it.
Signs point to it being a small model sharing a platform with one of the EVs parent company Stellantis will have launched by then through Citroen, Peugeot and Fiat, but something even more on-brand could be in the works.
At this year's Moab Easter Jeep Safari, the brand rolled out an all-electric Wrangler concept it called the Magneto. Rather than a purpose-built electric, it swapped out its internal combustion engine for an electric motor connected to its conventional 4x4 drivetrain, offering a relatively easy zero-emissions solution for the model in the short term.
During an appearance on The Fox Garage, Jeep's VP in charge of North American operations, Jim Morrison, was asked if the 2023 EV would be a unibody model or a Wrangler and his answer left the door wide open.
""I can't tell you, but there's a good chance of it maybe being both,"" Morrison said.
The Wrangler 4xe that President Biden took for a spin at the White House, which offers an all-electric range of 21 miles per charge and a combined power rating of 375 hp when its four-cylinder gasoline engine kicks in, has proven so popular with customers that it's sold out for the year.

Farther down the road, Jeep is also aiming to deliver a fully-autonomous Wrangler that could potentially drop passengers off at the head of a hiking trail and meet them at the other end, and Morrison said he thinks the goal is attainable.
""Our plan is this decade, and we keep pushing the limits on what accentuates freedom for our customers, and we think we can get there, for sure."""
56715,"When asked about the pipeline cyberattack this week in light of a push for renewable power, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm noted, ""If you drive an electric car, this would not be affecting you, clearly.""
As the Biden administration doesn't seem to be slowing down on its green energy agenda that includes electric vehicles, Granholm has until late August to fully divest up to $5 million in stock options from Proterra, a company that makes electric buses, car batteries and charging stations.
A top Republican senator has asked for an investigation into the secretary’s holdings and whether they present a conflict of interest with her department playing a key role in the Biden administration’s infrastructure plan that calls for $174 billion ""to win"" the electric vehicle market.
An Energy Department spokesperson said the secretary is working to fully divest from any firm that could give the appearance of a conflict of interest.
""Secretary Granholm has acted in full accordance with the comprehensive ethical standards set by the Biden administration,"" the Energy Department spokesperson told Fox News in an email statement. ""She is in the process of divesting all holdings in the company within the 180 days permitted by her ethics agreement.""
GRAHAM BLASTS BIDEN OFFICIAL'S REMARK ON PIPELINE ATTACK AND ELECTRIC CARS: ‘DUMBEST THING IN THE WORLD’
Granholm was sworn in as secretary on Feb. 25, which would mean the 180 days would end in late August. The spokesperson did not address whether the secretary still had investments in Proterra or how much remains.
Granholm sold stock in some of her investments but had not offloaded any of her Proterra shares at the time President Biden had an April 20 virtual tour of the company’s Greenville, S.C., facility, the Washington Free Beacon reported. A day earlier, Vice President Kamala Harris toured Thomas Built Busses, a manufacturer of electric school buses in High Point, N.C., which is a partner with Proterra in production.
Proterra is in the process of going public through a $1.6 billion merger with ArcLight Clean Transition Corp., which could be a lucrative deal for stockholders. Reuters reported in January the transaction was expected to close in the first half of 2021.
Granholm told Politico in late April: ""I had nothing to do with that trip. I resigned from Proterra, I signed an ethics agreement. I will divest of all my stock.""
Noting the tours, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, sent a letter to Energy Department Inspector General Teri Donaldson seeking an investigation.
AMERICA UNDER SIEGE ON BIDEN'S WATCH AS CYBERATTACKERS CRIPPLE THE COUNTRY
""The American people deserve transparency from their leaders,"" Barrasso told Fox News. ""Energy Secretary Granholm held millions of dollars of investments in an electric bus company, which was then toured by President Biden. She is playing a leading role in the Biden administration’s promotion of electric vehicles.""
Barrasso also noted the promises Granholm made during her Senate confirmation.
""During her nomination hearing, Secretary Granholm committed to the Senate that she would avoid the appearance of any conflicts of interest,"" Barrasso continued. ""This looks like a significant conflict of interest to me.""
During her confirmation, in response to a question from Barrasso, she said, ""If confirmed, I will recuse myself from all particular matters that to my knowledge have a direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of Proterra until I have completed the divestiture.""
In a Jan. 21 Senate questionnaire, Granholm, a former Michigan governor, responded ""Yes"" to the question: ""Have you taken appropriate action to avoid any conflict of interest or any appearance of a conflict of interest?"" She also responded ""Yes"" to the question: ""If confirmed, will you adhere to the committee’s recusal policy?""
In her ethics agreement with the Biden administration, Granholm agreed to ""avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest"" and to resign from her board position at Proterra upon confirmation; forfeit her unvested stock options in Proterra Inc. upon resignation of her position as Board Member of Proterra Inc.; and to divest her vested stock options and resulting stock if she exercises her vested stock options in Proterra ""as soon as practicable but not later than 180 days"" after her confirmation.
One day before Granholm was sworn in, on Feb. 24 Biden issued an executive order that tasked his incoming energy secretary with submitting ""a report identifying risks in the supply chain for high-capacity batteries, including electric-vehicle batteries, and policy recommendations to address these risks.""

Biden’s American Jobs Plan proposes spending $174 billion ""to win the EV market"" for a package that includes tax incentives and grant programs for state and local governments as well as private companies to build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers by 2030. The plan also calls for replacing 50,000 diesel transit vehicles and electrifying at least one in five school busses to ""set us on a path to 100 percent clean buses,"" according to a White House press release.
""I am concerned that activities Secretary Granholm may have been directly or indirectly engaged in within the Biden Administration to promote electric vehicles (including electric buses), batteries, and charging infrastructure may have violated general commitments she made during her nomination process and as she entered the Biden Administration ‘to avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest;’ to ‘avoid any actions creating the appearance of violating the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch;’ and to conduct ‘decision-making on the merits and exclusively in the public interest, without regard to private gain or personal benefit,’"" Barrasso’s letter to the inspector general said."

Americans across the political spectrum recognize the benefits of fairness. We like to find a good deal, get the best bang for our buck, and be able to say the juice was worth the squeeze.
Recently, we have been inundated with images like those of President Joe Biden grinning from ear to ear seated in an all-electric Cadillac Lyriq as the administration continued to tout electric vehicles (EVs) as the savior of the climate. However, it’s important to look past the politics to consider the facts and data surrounding EVs. In graduate school, my statistics instructor quipped, ""Numbers and people are a lot alike. If you torture them enough, they’ll tell you anything you want to know."" No need to torture here. By simply examining data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, we can easily find the truth about the value of EVs.
As a licensed forester, I support environmental stewardship, reducing carbon emissions, and ensuring clean air and water. As a professional engineer, I’m fascinated by technology and support solutions that actually work. EVs are not the solution, and the numbers show the juice is not worth the squeeze.
BIDEN PROMOTES EXPENSIVE ELECTRIC VEHICLES AT AUTO SHOW AMID RECORD INFLATION
If we could wave a magic wand and turn every U.S. passenger car into an EV, global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) would be reduced by a mere 0.9%. Try the math for yourself:
The U.S. produces 15% of the world’s GHGs, transportation accounts for 27% of those emissions, and 57% of transportation emissions come from passenger cars and light duty trucks. That means if every car was an EV with batteries charged from a non-carbon emitting source, GHGs would be reduced by 2.3%. Only 39% of U.S electricity, however, comes from non-carbon emitting sources. Therefore, realistically, if every car in the U.S. was an EV, carbon in the world’s atmosphere would be reduced by less than 1%.
EXPERTS SLAM PETE BUTTIGIEG'S COMMENTS ON EVS: ‘A CON JOB’
Why has California played along with the fantasy by outlawing the sale of gas-powered cars after 2035, then narrowly dodged rolling blackouts by telling residents to avoid charging their electric cars and using big appliances like washing machines during peak hours?
California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned those who would fight against this absurdity as ""doubling down on stupid."" It’s arguable that any reasonable individual who could do basic math would see it the other way around.
Not only do Democrats want to ban gas powered cars, but they also actively work to cancel domestic mining of critical minerals that make electric cars possible.
In March, President Biden cancelled the lease for the Minnesota Twin Metals mining company that would provide copper, nickel, cobalt, and platinum needed for electronic products. Democrats know these minerals are vital, but they force us to rely on countries like China and the Democratic Republic of the Congo that use slave labor, child labor, and have few, if any, real environmental or labor laws.

Democrats are smothering American mining and energy companies in over regulation, driving prices through the roof to force a ""green transition,"" while simultaneously throttling American jobs with ""not in my backyard"" policies.
The world is using more of every form of energy and we’re seeing an insatiable global appetite for new energy. New spending for EVs has already cost taxpayers $34 billion since President Biden took office, and that’s just a drop in the bucket of what this administration wants to spend going forward. At the same time, developing countries are building fossil fuel energy systems at a larger scale and pace than the U.S. can offset our emissions, much less theirs.
What’s more, Americans simply can’t afford this false transition. A new Census poll found that 26% of Americans were forced to choose between basic expenses like food and medicine to pay their energy bills, while one in six reported the inability to pay the full amount of their energy bills at least once in the past year. This is unacceptable when we can affordably meet our energy needs through this country’s vast natural resources.

We don’t have to choose between our economy and our environment. Innovation and improving efficiency in areas that work, such as nuclear, natural gas, and hydrogen, while focusing on large scale natural solutions such as forest management, tree planting, biochar, and precision agriculture will not only improve our domestic statistics, but will also provide affordable, reliable, and clean technologies for the developing world.
To meet the world’s energy needs while being good environmental stewards, we must embrace an all-of-the-above energy approach coupled with robust research, development, and innovation. Putting all our eggs in the EV basket is nonsensical, wastes hard-earned taxpayer dollars, and is detrimental to our future. Democrat's EV policy is not giving us the best bang for our buck."
